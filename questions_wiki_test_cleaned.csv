"What is the estimated mass of the supermassive black hole at the core of NGC 5548, and how does it compare to the mass of the Sun?",4277163,"NGC 5548 is a Type I Seyfert galaxy with a bright, active nucleus. This activity is caused by matter flowing onto a 65 million solar mass (M☉) supermassive black hole at the core. Morphologically, this is an unbarred lenticular galaxy with tightly-wound spiral arms, while shell and tidal tail features suggest that it has undergone a cosmologically-recent merger or interaction event. NGC 5548 is approximately 245 million light years away and appears in the constellation Boötes. The apparent visual magnitude of NGC 5548 is approximately 13.3 in the V band. In 1943, this galaxy was one of twelve nebulae listed by American astronomer Carl Keenan Seyfert that showed broad emission lines in their nuclei. Members of this class of objects became known as Seyfert galaxies, and they were noted to have a higher than normal surface brightness in their nuclei. Observation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with radio telescopes showed an enhanced level of radio emission. Spectrograms of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few parsecs across, where temperature were around 14000 K and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of ±450 km/s. Among astronomers, the accepted explanation for the active nucleus in NGC 5548 is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core. This object is surrounded by an orbiting disk of accreted matter drawn in from the surroundings. As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes photoionized, producing broad emission lines in the optical and ultraviolet bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1–14 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane. The mass of the central black hole can be estimated based on the properties of the emission lines in the core region. Combined measurements yield an estimated mass of 6.54+0.26−0.25×107 M☉. In other words, it is some 65 million times the mass of the Sun. This result is consistent with other methods of estimating the mass of the SMBH in the nucleus of NGC 5548. Matter is falling onto this black hole at the estimated rate of 0.03 M☉ per year, whereas mass is flowing outward from the core at or above the rate of 0.92 M☉ each year. The inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the SMBH forms a thick, hot corona spanning several light hours that is emitting X-rays. When this radiation reaches the optically thick part of the accretion disk at a radius of around 1–2 light days, the X-rays are converted into heat.",2.749
"What was the original function of the castle that occupied the site where the Tour de l'Honneur stands today, according to 12th century documents?",33593050,"The tour de l'Honneur is a tower and the only remain of the château de Lesparre.

Because of Eleanor of Aquitaine marriage with Henri Plantagenêt, the castle became part of England for almost three centuries, until 1453. During middle age, the Lesparre controlled a large part of the Médoc. The castle was visited by famous Occitan speakers, such as the troubadours Aimeric de Belenoi and Pey de Corbian. The castle later belonged to the Madaillan family, the Albret family, the Foix family, the Clèves family, the Matignon family, the Épernon family and the Gramont family, before being sold as a national property during the French Revolution and was almost completely dismantled soon after. The alternative name of the castle was « Château de l'honneur de Lesparre », so the only tower remaining today has been named « Tour de l'honneur ».

In contemporary Judaism, as the term rabbi has become commonplace, the term rav has come to apply to rabbis with levels of knowledge, experience, and wisdom in excess of those found among the majority of rabbis who serve Jewish congregations as a career.

"What is the primary threat to the survival of Physaria thamnophila, also known as Zapata bladderpod, a rare species of flowering plant endemic to southern Texas?",41397590,"Physaria thamnophila is a rare species of flowering plant in the mustard family known by the common name Zapata bladderpod. It is native to Texas in the United States, where it is known from Zapata and Starr Counties. The plant is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat. It is federally listed as an endangered species. This is a perennial herb producing one or more spreading stems from a woody base. The stems grow to 80 centimeters in maximum length. The herbage is silvery in color due to a coat of branching hairs. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped and smooth to faintly toothed on the edges, the lowest leaves reaching 12 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a raceme of yellow flowers. Blooming can occur through September whenever there is enough moisture. The population size can also increase rapidly after a significant amount of rainfall. This plant grows in desert shrublands above the Rio Grande floodplain in southern Texas. The substrate is calcareous clay and sandstone in geologic formations that contain an abundance of fossils. The terrain is sparsely covered by thorny shrubs and cacti, with the plant community dominated by Leucophyllum frutescens and Acacia berlandieri. Other plants in the habitat include Acacia rigidula, Prosopis spp. (mesquite), Celtis pallida (granjeno), Yucca treculeana, Zizyphus obtusifolia (lotebush), and Guaiacum angustifolium (guayacan). Some shrubs may serve as nurse plants to the bladderpod, which grows in their shade and may benefit from their protection from soil erosion and herbivory by animals. This plant was thought to be limited to Zapata and Starr Counties in Texas, but there has been a documented population south of the border in Tamaulipas and the plant may occur in Webb County, Texas. There are approximately eleven populations known, but only about seven of these still exist. During dry spells the populations can shrink to low numbers, but flourish again when rain occurs. The main threat to the species is habitat destruction and modification. Non-native grass species have been introduced to the region to make pastures for grazing. Some areas have then become overgrazed. The landscape has been cleared and developed and associated infrastructure has been installed, including highways and transmission lines. There is active petroleum exploration occurring in the area.",3.606

"What is the effect on CsgD's DNA-binding capacity when it is phosphorylated at amino acid residue 59 (A.A. D59) of its primary sequence, according to a transcription analysis assay?",55992077,"CsgD is a transcription and response regulator protein referenced to as the master modulator of bacterial biofilm development. In E. coli cells, CsgD is tasked with aiding the transition from planktonic cell motility to the stationary phase of biofilm formation, in response to environmental growth factors. A transcription analysis assay illustrated a heightened decrease in CsgD's DNA-binding capacity when phosphorylated at A.A. D59 of the protein's primary sequence. Therefore, in the protein's active form (unphosphorylated), CsgD is capable of carrying out its normal functions of regulating curli proteins (fimbria) and producing ECM polysaccharides (cellulose). Following a promoter-lacZ fusion assay of CsgD binding to specific target sites on E. coli's genome, two classes of binding targets were identified: group I genes and group II genes. The group I genes, akin to fliE and yhbT, exhibit repressed transcription following their interaction with CsgD, whilst group II genes, including yccT and adrA, illustrated active functionality. Other group I operons that illustrate repressed transcription include fliE and fliEFGH, for motile flagellum formation. Other group II genes, imperative to the transition towards stationary biofilm development, include csgBA, encoding for curli fimbriae, and adrA, encoding for the synthesis of cyclic diguanylate. In this context, c-di-GMP functions as a bacterial secondary messenger, enhancing the production of extracellular cellulose and impeding flagellum production and rotation.",0.057
What is the approximate length of the Middle Fork South Platte River?,1850607,"The Middle Fork South Platte River is a tributary of the South Platte River, approximately 50 miles (80 km) long, located in central Colorado in the United States.

The river rises in northwestern Park County, at the continental divide along the north side of Mount Lincoln, just west of Hoosier Pass. It descends to the southeast in a narrow valley along State Highway 9 past Alma, emerging into the northwest end of South Park at Fairplay, which sits on a bluff on the east side of the river. It crosses South Park towards the southeast, between the watersheds of Tarryall Creek to the north and the South Fork South Platte River to the south, running along the western side of Red Hill, receiving several smaller creeks. It joins the South Fork from the north to the South Platte main branch just east of Hartsel, approximately two miles (3.2 km) east of the junction of State Highway 9 and U.S. Highway 24.

Lo-En lies southeast of Eniwetok which rises above sea level, and Lo-En is almost connected to it through a ridge. The seamount is formed by basaltic rocks that probably formed a shield volcano first. It is believed that a number of hotspots such as the Macdonald hotspot, the Rarotonga hotspot and the Rurutu hotspot may have been involved in the formation of Lo-En. After volcanic activity, by the Turonian the seamount was submerged although it is possible that a carbonate platform formed during the Albian. After a hiatus, sedimentation commenced on the seamount in Oligocene time and led to the deposition of manganese crusts and pelagic sediments including limestone, some of which were later modified by phosphate.",0.072

"Here's a question based on the provided text:

What was the unique characteristic of the Order of Aubrac in the 11th century, according to later tradition and its chartering in 1120 or 1122?",21650593,"The Order of Aubrac was a military order and hospital (hôtel-Dieu) chartered in the twelfth century. It operated in the Rouergue to protect and care for pilgrims on the Way of Saint James and the Via Francigena. The headquarters of the order was the monastery and hospital called the Dômerie d'Aubrac in the town of Aubrac in the Diocese of Rodez. According to later tradition, it was founded in 1031 by Adalard, viscount of Flanders, who was beset by brigands while passing through the County of Rouergue on his way to the shrine of Saint James in Compostela. If this later story is accurate, then the Order of Aubrac is a unique example in the eleventh century of a military order in the style of the later Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller. The Order was chartered in 1120 or 1122 and adopted the Augustinian rule with the approval of Bishop Peter of Rodez in 1162. The Order's statutes from that year survive. They were revised several times in the later Middle Ages. The Order included priests, knights, lay brothers, noblewomen and lay sisters. Satellite hospitals, called ""commanderies"", were established at Bozouls, Milhau, Najac, and Rodez. Though never large, the Knights Hospitaller failed in several attempts to annex it and it remained independent and operational until the French Revolution, when it disappeared. Paul Crawford in his 1993 study of military orders, classifies Aubrac as one of the ""hospitaller orders which may have had military functions"" alongside Order of Saint James of Altopascio and the Order of Saint Anthony of Vienne, while noting that it is the only one of the three that seems definitely to have had a military status.",0.125

"What was the outcome of Moses of Crete's apocalyptic prophecy, which promised to lead the people dry-shod through the sea back to their old Holy Land?",23936508,"Moses of Crete was a Jewish Messiah claimant and apocalyptic prophet in the 5th century A.D. After the failed Bar Kokba war, there was an end to Messianic movements for several centuries. However, the hope of a coming messiah nonetheless continued. In accordance with one interpretation of the Talmud, the Messiah was expected in 440 or 471. This expectation in connection with the disturbances in the Roman empire attendant upon invasions may have raised hopes in a messiah claimant who appeared about this time in Crete, and who won the Jews there to his movement. He called himself Moses, and promised to lead the people, like the ancient Moses, dry-shod through the sea back to their old Holy Land of Israel and Judea. His followers, convinced of his claim, left all their possessions and waited for the promised day; upon which they followed Moses to a promontory overlooking the sea and at his command cast themselves off - where many drowned or were destroyed on the rocks below. Then Moses himself immediately disappeared. Socrates of Constantinople states that Moses fled, while the Chronicle of John of Nikiû claims that he perished in the sea. Others claimed he had been a demon, sent to lead the Jews astray. While he called himself ""Moses"", the Chronicle gives his actual name as 'Fiskis'.",0.608

"What is the main instrument used in the song ""Vitamin L"" by B.E. Taylor Group, and how does its role compare to the guitar's part in the track?",24069493,"""Vitamin L"" is a song by the American pop rock band B.E. Taylor Group. It is the fifth track on the band's second studio album, Love Won the Fight, and also the third single pulled from that album. In a departure of the norm of B. E. Taylor singing lead vocals, drummer Joey d'Amico sings lead on this track. It also heavily uses synthesizers and a brass sections as the main instruments. The guitar's role is minimized to a steady strumming pattern with sustained power chords in the chorus. The lyrics tell the story of a man whose medical condition can only be treated with an unstable drug, called Vitamin L, that reacts ""when boy meets girl"". In the last verse, it is revealed the drug was, in fact, love, and the man is cured of his ailment when he falls in love with a woman. This song is the B. E. Taylor Group's most popular song, as it peaked at #66 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984 and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. The song also spawned a popular music video that scored heavy airplay on MTV. B. E. and Rick Witkowsi are featured as the doctor and pharmacist in the video, respectively. The song also is a near constant at live performances. B. E. Taylor later re-recorded this song on his first solo album, Try Love, as more of a rock song, getting rid of the synthesizers and making the bass, lead guitar, and drums much more involved. The lyrics in the verses have entire lines changed as well, mildly changing the story in the process, e.g. ""A chemical reaction occurs/Every time that boys meets girl"" to ""It could keep us all in touch/But we can never take too much"", erasing the idea that the vitamin is an unstable drug. Three whole lines in the third verse are changed, but these do not change the story in any way.",3.621

"What was the condition of the Lena Highway before 2014, and how did this affect travel during different seasons?",15682173,"A360 Lena Highway or The Amur-Yakutsk Highway is a federal highway in Sakha (Yakutia) in Russia, connecting Yakutsk with the Trans-Siberian Railway corridor near Skovorodino. The road was built in stages between 1925 and 1964. Stretching parallel to the Amur–Yakutsk Mainline railway, the highway takes its name from the Lena River, which runs more or less north–south in this part of Siberia. The road's southern terminus is at the village of Never near Skovorodino, where it intersects the R297 highway at a cloverleaf junction. With Yakutsk situated entirely on the west bank of Lena, and the road running on the east bank, the highway terminates in Nizhny Bestyakh, a settlement of 4,000 people opposite Yakutsk. When river conditions permit, one may drive right over the frozen river to Yakutsk or take the ferry, but much of the year the river is impassable due to flooding, ice floes or semi-thawed ice not supporting the weight of vehicles. At Nizhny Bestyakh, Lena Highway connects to Kolyma Highway, designated R504, linking Yakutsk with Magadan on the Pacific Ocean to the east. Although it is a federal highway, it was just a dirt road until 2014. When frozen in the winter, this made for an excellent surface, and the posted speed limit was 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph). However, in the summer, with any kind of significant rain, the road transformed to impassable mud that often swallowed whole smaller vehicles. The last problematic part of the highway was paved in 2014 and now it is accessible all throughout the year as far as Tyungyulyu. However, the bridge over the Lena river is still not constructed. The only transport working across the river when it is congested with floating ice are helicopters and hydrofoils.",5.862

It was an important Archaic Period settlement co-temporaneous with Lato and Prinias. Strabo describes it as lying west of Cydonia, at the distance of 30 stadia from the sea, and 60 from Phalasarna, and as containing a temple of Dictynna. He adds that the Polyrrhenians formerly dwelt in villages, and that they were collected into one place by the Achaeans and Lacedaemonians, who built a strong city looking towards the south. In the civil wars in Crete in the time of the Achaean League, 219 BCE, the Polyrrhenians, who had been subject allies of Knossos, deserted the latter, and assisted the Lyctians against that city. They also sent auxiliary troops to the assistance of the Achaeans, because the Knossians had supported the Aetolians. In a successful campaign they prevented their rival cities Knossos and Gortys from dominating the entire island and brought a large part over to the Macedonian coalition. Polyrrhenia continued to flourish in the Roman period, when the center shifted to its erstwhile port, Cisamus, and in this urbanistic configuration lasted into Byzantine times. A small town now occupies the site, where rock-cut tombs, ruins and an acropolis remain. A Roman aqueduct built in the age of Hadrian improved water supplies.

These three breeds are collectively referred to as ""Anatolian Native"" cattle, and are distinguished on morphological and regional grounds, rather than genetically. The breed is considered at risk of extinction, and the number of genetically pure individuals has decreased.

"What was the outcome of Andrew ""Cap"" Tilles' trial for operating a bucket shop in St. Louis, and how did it affect his legal standing?",41312835,"Andrew ""Cap"" Tilles was an American business magnate and philanthropist. At an early age, Tilles adopted his childhood nickname of Cap, which he used for the rest of his life. Tilles revolutionized the United States horse racing industry. Later in life, Tilles dedicated his resources to philanthropic projects in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1896, he co-founded and actively ran an investment syndicate that dominated the US horse racing industry through World War I. The investment syndicate became known in the media as the ""Big Three,"" after its three principal partners: Louis A. Cella, Samuel W. Adler, and C. A. Tilles. The syndicate was officially known as C.A.T., which was short for the Cella, Adler, and Tilles partnership. In 1905, Tilles was forced to close his race tracks, as a result of progressive politics abolishing gambling in Missouri. The closing of the tracks eventually resulted in a multimillion-dollar personal fortune for Tilles with the sale of the partnership's land holdings in St. Louis. The Delmar Race track land was particularly lucrative property for sale and development along the famed Loop of Delmar Boulevard. Tilles used his fortune to expand C.A.T. across the country. By 1914, Tilles had acquired 25 horse racing tracks across the United States, the most of any investor in US history. In 1901, he founded the Western Turf Association, which eventually monopolized the Midwestern and Southern track systems. By World War I, the Big Three had acquired most every major non-coastal horse race track in the heart of the country, with the exceptions of Hawthorne Race Course in Chicago and Churchill Downs. As president, Tilles revolutionized the horse racing industry by introducing electricity to the game, developing the modern system of licensing book makers, and holding the first-ever recorded instance of night racing. Tilles was also associated with the cigar, real estate, stock, and brokerage businesses. In 1901, C.A.T. took ownership of the Delmar Investment Company, which among its holdings included a bucket shop. In 1909, bucket shops were declared illegal by the Anti-Bucket Shop Act of Congress. In 1910, Tilles and his partners at the Delmar Investment Company were arrested in the Western Union bucket shop scandal. Federal agents raided Western Union and uncovered a secret and illegal telegraph and ticker service for bucket shops across the country. In 1911, Tilles was extradited to Washington, D.C., to stand trial for illegally operating and conspiring to operate a bucket shop in St. Louis. On October 10, 1911, the case was dismissed in favor of Tilles' acquittal after the Anti-Bucket Shop Act was declared unconstitutional by Justice Wright of the district of Columbia Supreme Court. In later years, Tilles turned towards philanthropy. Among his other charitable acts, Tilles initiated a million dollar foundation for the education of poor children.

"What process or event has reshaped the outer rim of the Klaproth crater over its long history, resulting in deep erosion, incision, and reformation?",1216264,"Klaproth is an old lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon's near side. Due to its location, this crater appears significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. The southern rim of the crater is overlain by the similar-sized crater Casatus, and to the north-northeast lies Blancanus. The outer rim of Klaproth has been deeply eroded, incised, and reshaped by a long history of bombardment. The rim to the north and east remains relatively circular, but the original rim along the western face has been overlain by satellite craters Klaproth G and Klaproth H, and other impacts. To the south the crater Casatus significantly intrudes into the interior floor. The remaining floor has been resurfaced by some material in the past, possibly fluidized ejecta or lava, leaving a level and nearly featureless surface that is marked only by a multitude of tiny craterlets. If this walled-plain once possessed a central peak, it no longer exists. The crater was named after Martin Heinrich Klaproth, the German chemist and discoverer of Uranium.",1.643

"What is the effect of applying treble damages to an award of $100 for an injury, as described in the text?",5183680,"In United States law, treble damages is a term that indicates that a statute permits a court to triple the amount of the actual/compensatory damages to be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff. Treble damages are usually a multiple of, rather than an addition to, actual damages, but on occasion they are additive, as in California Civil Code § 1719. When such damages are multiplicative and a person received an award of $100 for an injury, a court applying treble damages would raise the award to $300. Some statutes mandate awards of treble damages for all violations, such as the Clayton Antitrust Act and RICO. Some statutes allow for an award of treble damages only if there is a showing that the violation was willful. For example, ""up to three times the amount found or assessed"" may be awarded by a court in the United States for willful patent infringement. The idea behind the creation of such damages is that they will encourage citizens to sue for violations that are harmful to society in general, and deter the violator from committing future violations. The United States Supreme Court determined in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. that, like compensatory damages, which are not exempt from federal income tax, such taxes must be paid on the excess amount of treble damages. Furthermore, some foreign governments will assist U.S. citizens in collecting damages, but not treble damage awards, which are considered penal.",2.877

What was the primary theme or organizational structure used in the Wernigerode Armorial to present coats of arms, starting from folio 20v?",38740135,"The Wernigerode Armorial is an armorial compiled in southern Germany in the late 15th century. The book was formerly in possession of the Schaffhauser family of Schaffhausen, Ehingen am Ries, near Nördlingen, later kept in the Stolberg library of Wernigerode, with the dissolution of this library in 1927/8 passing into the private possession of Otto Hupp, and finally bought by the Bavarian State Library in 1949. The manuscript is the first of originally two volumes; the second volume has been lost. A third volume consists of a register to vols. 1 and 2, kept in the Halle University Library. It is an important witness of the transitional period from medieval to classical conventions of heraldry. On 261 folia it presents various coats of arms, as was the custom at the time in order of descending rank, beginning with a number of purely fictitious or symbolic coats of arms, that of God, of Jesus Christ, of Death, of the ""first arms"" of kings Abysay, Sabytay, Banabias, of ""King Alphonsus of Castilia"", ""the holy King Job"", the ""holy knight Eustachius"", followed by the (real) royal arms of Sweden, Austria and Thuringia, and the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies. After this, the armorial presents the actual coats of arms in use at the time, beginning with the papal arms of Innocent VIII, the imperial arms of Habsburg Austria and the Imperial Eagle of the Holy Roman Emperor, the royal arms of France, England and Greece. More royal and ducal arms are given, partly real and partly fictitious, including those of the Dauphin, Wessex(?), Italy, Ireland, Outremer, and of ""Calistria, queen of the Amazons"", Brittany, ""the great Khan"", Arabia, Nineveh, Granada,
Bavaria, Hessen, Bavaria-Straubing and the Duke of Teck, Lorenzo de' Medici, the ""Sultan of Jerusalem"", some ""eastern empires"" such as Persia, India, Prester John, ""Constantine"", Cathay (China), Scotland, Aragon, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Poland, Antiochia, Ethiopia, Salerno, Castilia, Troy, Nebuchadnezzar, Nero. After this preface, the book begins a more realistic listing of the heraldry of its time, beginning on fol. 20v, organized as follows:
The arms of the territories and noble families of the kingdom of Spain, of the high nobility of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgundy, Savoy, Milan and Naples; the higher nobility of the Holy Roman Empire in the duchies of Kleve, Geldern, Liegnitz, Werdenberg, Württemberg, the Habsburg territories, and the arms of various counts.

"What is the primary objective of vouching, according to the definition provided in the text?",24525465,"Vouching is a technical term that refers to the inspection of documentary evidence supporting and substantiating a financial transaction, by an auditor. It is the essence of auditing Vouching is the practice followed in an audit, with the objective of establishing the authenticity of the transactions recorded in the primary books of account. It essentially consists of verifying a transaction recorded in the books of account with the relevant documentary evidence and the authority on the basis of which the entry has been made; also confirming that the amount mentioned in the voucher has been posted to an appropriate account which would disclose the nature of the transaction on its inclusion in the final statements of account. Vouching does not include valuation. Vouching can be described as the essence or backbone of auditing. The success of an audit depends on the thoroughness with which vouching is done. After entering in all vouchers, only then can auditing start. Vouching is defined as the ""verification of entries in the books of account by examination of documentary evidence or vouchers, such as invoices, debit and credit notes, statements, receipts, etc. The object of vouching is to establish that the transactions recorded in the books of accounts are (1) in order and have been properly authorized and (2) are correctly recorded. “Simple routine checking cannot establish the same accuracy that vouching can. In routine checking, entries recorded in the books only show what information the bookkeeper chooses to disclose, however these entries can be fictitious without any vouching or vouchers. By using a vouching or a voucher system a company will have concrete and solid documentation and evidence of expenses, capital, and written proof in audits. Vouching is the essence or backbone of auditing because when performing an audit, an auditor must have proof of all transactions. Without the proof provided by vouching, the claims provided by the auditor are just that, only claims. In most cases, hard to detect frauds can only be discovered through the use of vouching. This means that the auditor must conduct vouching with great importance, if not, he can be charged with negligence which happened in the case of Armitage v. Brewer and Knott. Through this case, the importance of vouching was realized. In this case, the auditors were found to be guilty on negligence, because the auditors did not display enough reasonable care and skill in vouching the wage sheets and ended up failing to detect fraud in manipulation of these wage records and cash vouchers. When delivering the decision the Judge stated that ""It was clear that a good many documents were suspicious on either face and called for Inquiry"". It was declared that it was essential that due care and attention are to be given to vouching in auditing.",1.682

"What substance did Ortolanus believe held the key to attaining the quintessence, according to his commentary on The Emerald Tablet?",43446045,"Ortolanus, also known as Hortulanus, was a medieval alchemist. Little information exists about his life and identity. He is best known for his influential commentary on The Emerald Tablet entitled Liber super textum Hermetis. It was composed before 1325, and the original work has two sections. The first is entitled Spiritus quinte essentie et in quo elemento habitat. It is dedicated to making a prodigious substance, the quintessence, from a mysterious material called argento vivo, which happens to be wine. Ortholan is the first author to relate alcohol and quintessence, half a century before Jean de Roquetaillade. In his opinion, the quintessence would be present everywhere, but it can best be attained through certain substances, ideally wine. The second part is a theoretical text. It is written as a comment to the Emerald Tablet attributed to Hermes. Its theme revolves around the primordial heat, praised by Hermes as a universal substrate that gives dynamism to the whole cosmos. Ortolanus believes alcohol or quintessence is the hidden primordial heat in all material things. This second part was published in the alchemical compilation In hoc volumine de alchemia continentur hæc (1541). It was printed again in 1545. A 1560 edition appeared under the name Compendium alchimiae and was attributed to Johannes de Garlandia (philologist). Another edition followed in 1571. With this widespread publishing, the second section became very popular among alchemists of the Early modern period. The first part, which was never published, was forgotten and no one related Ortolanus to the development of the concept of quintaessencia.",1.763
"What event occurred in September in ancient Rome, marking the passing of the political year during the Republican era?",40384929,"September or mensis September was originally the seventh of ten months on the ancient Roman calendar that began with March. It had 29 days. After the reforms that resulted in a 12-month year, September became the ninth month, but retained its name. September followed what was originally Sextilis, the ""sixth"" month, renamed Augustus in honor of the first Roman emperor, and preceded October, the ""eighth"" month that like September retained its numerical name contrary to its position on the calendar. A day was added to September in the mid-40s BC as part of the Julian calendar reform. September has none of the archaic festivals that are marked in large letters for other months on extant Roman fasti. Instead, about half the month is devoted to the Ludi Romani, ""Roman Games"", which developed as votive games for Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The Ludi Romani are the oldest games instituted by the Romans, dating from 509 BC. On the Ides of September, Jupiter was honored with a public banquet, the Epulum Jovis. A nail-driving ritual in the temple marked the passing of the political year during the Republican era, and in the earliest period, the consuls took office on the Ides of September. The month was often represented in art by the grape harvest. September was the birth month of no fewer than four major Roman emperors, including Augustus. The emperor Commodus renamed the month after either himself or Hercules—an innovation that was repealed after his murder in 192. In the Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, the year began with September on some calendars, and was the beginning of the imperial tax year.",3.693
What was the primary purpose of the Merritt Island Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network station (MILA) during its final years?,23561305,"The Merritt Island Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network station, known in NASA parlance as MILA, was a radio communications and spacecraft tracking complex located on 61 acres (0.25 km2) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. The name MILA was an acronym for the ""Merritt Island Launch Annex"" to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which was how the site was referred to when spacecraft launches were primarily originating from the adjacent military installation. MILA's arrays of antennas provided various communications and data services between spacecraft and NASA centers, as well as tracked and ranged moving spacecraft. In its final years, it served as the primary voice and data link during the first 7½ minutes of Space Shuttle launches, and the final 13 minutes of shuttle landings at KSC.

What was the primary objective behind the establishment of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2004?,26587367,"The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable palm oil products through global standards and multistakeholder governance. The seat of the association is in Zürich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is currently based in Kuala Lumpur, with a satellite office in Jakarta. RSPO currently has 5,650 members from 94 countries. The RSPO was established following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts resulting from palm oil production. 51,999,404 metric tonnes of palm oil produced in 2016 was RSPO certified. Products containing Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) can carry the RSPO trademark. Members of the RSPO include palm oil producers, environmental groups, and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products. In 2014, Indonesia accounted for 40% of global palm oil production and 44% of the total RSPO-certified areas. After the meeting in 2009, a number of environmental organisations were critical of the scope of the agreements reached. Palm oil growers who produce CSPO have been critical of the organization because, though they have met RSPO standards and assumed the costs associated with certification, the market demand for certified palm oil remains low. Even though deforestation has decreased in RSPO-certified oil palm plantations, peatlands continue to be drained and burned for the creation of new RSPO-certified palm plantations.",3.25

"Here's a question based on the given sentence:

What type of processes typically characterize population processes, and how do they relate to demographic processes and environmental effects?",239384,"In applied probability, a population process is a Markov chain in which the state of the chain is analogous to the number of individuals in a population, and changes to the state are analogous to the addition or removal of individuals from the population. Typical population processes include birth–death processes and birth, death and catastrophe processes. Although named by analogy to biological populations from population dynamics, population processes find application in a much wider range of fields than just ecology and other biological sciences. These other applications include telecommunications and queueing theory, chemical kinetics and financial mathematics, and hence the ""population"" could be of packets in a computer network, of molecules in a chemical reaction, or even of units in a financial index. Population processes are typically characterized by processes of birth and immigration, and of death, emigration and catastrophe, which correspond to the basic demographic processes and broad environmental effects to which a population is subject. However, population processes are also often equivalent to other processes that may typically be characterised under other paradigms. Queues, for example, are often characterised by an arrivals process, a service process, and the number of servers. In appropriate circumstances, however, arrivals at a queue are functionally equivalent to births or immigration and the service of waiting ""customers"" is equivalent to death or emigration. ",0.764

"What feature sets Helsinki slang apart from other dialects of Finnish, despite being considered a dialect in its own right?",1638391,"Helsinki slang or stadin slangi is a local dialect and a sociolect of the Finnish language mainly used in the capital city of Helsinki. It is characterized by its abundance of foreign loan words not found in the other Finnish dialects. Helsinki slang first evolved in the late 19th century as a sociolect of the multilingual Helsinki working-class communities, where Swedish- and Finnish-speaking youth lived together with Russian, German and various other language minorities. Helsinki slang is not a typical dialect of Finnish, because unlike many other parts of Finland, the Helsinki area was predominantly Swedish-speaking during the time when the city of Helsinki originally evolved, and thus Helsinki slang is characterised by an unusual, strikingly large number of obvious foreign loanwords. Nevertheless, Helsinki slang is counted as a dialect on its own right, among the purer dialects of other parts of Finland. Grammatically Helsinki slang is based on colloquial Finnish. It is characterized by a large number of words originally borrowed from Swedish, German and Russian, but nowadays chiefly English. The loanwords replace some of even the most mundane Finnish-language words with foreign alternatives. However, when spoken by a native Finnish speaker, all words are inflected by the rules of spoken Finnish, and the language sounds distinctively Finnish. The language's history can generally be divided into the old slang and the new or modern slang. Old slang was common in Helsinki up to the mid-20th century, and is thicker and harder to understand for an outsider of the group, even to one who would be capable in modern slang, because it incorporates a far greater number of Swedish, German and Russian loan-words than the modern variation. Old slang is mostly spoken by older Helsinkians, many of whom consider it the only true slang. The modern variety has evolved side-by-side with the growing influence of English-language youth subcultures starting from the 1950s. It is thus characterized by a greater influence of the English language and proper Finnish language while the influence of Swedish, German and Russian has declined. The modern slang is healthy and continues to evolve. It is spoken to varying degrees by almost all native Helsinkians.",1.768
"What was the initial limit set by Congress for the number of units that could be converted under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, and how many units had been applied to convert by October 2014?",51060119,"The Rental Assistance Demonstration is a federal housing program that was enacted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, and is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD). Broadly, the purpose of the Rental Assistance Demonstration is to provide a set of tools to address the unmet capital needs of deeply affordable, federally assisted rental housing properties in order to maintain both the viability of the properties and their long-term affordability. It also simplifies the administrative oversight of the properties by the federal government. Specifically, RAD authorizes the conversion of a property's federal funding from one form to another, where the initial form presents structural impediments to private capital investment and the new form is not only familiar to lenders and investors but, since its enactment in 1974, has leveraged billions in private investment for the development and rehabilitation of deeply affordable rental housing. RAD has been amended by four pieces of legislation: Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014
Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015;
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. and
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. Initially, Congress capped the number of units that could be converted under RAD at 60,000, but by October 2014 it was reported that HUD had received applications to convert more than 184,000 units. In FY2015 Congress reauthorized RAD and increased the cap to 185,000 units. An independent assessment of the program from its inception through the autumn of 2015 found that, using existing resources of $250 million, the program had leveraged approximately $2.5 billion in capital investment. In FY2017, Congress again reauthorized RAD, once again increasing the cap, this time to 225,000 units. It was raised again in FY2018 to 455,000 units.",1.117

"What was Rear Admiral Andrew I. McKee's primary responsibility when he joined the staff of Commander Service Force, Pacific Fleet, as senior assistant fleet maintenance officer aboard USS Mount McKinley in 1945?",2428913,"Rear Admiral Andrew I. McKee was a pioneer in modern submarine design and development. The destroyer USS Schenck was named for his maternal great-grandfather, Admiral James F. Schenck. McKee graduated from the United States Naval Academy at the top of his class in navigation and was commissioned an ensign in March 1917. He served with USS Huntington until he severely injured both legs in a fall from the mast in August 1917. He was declared unfit for sea duty, and assigned first to the Naval Academy as a navigation and physics instructor, and then as the supervisory naval constructor at Bethlehem Steel Corporation Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, pending admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1921 he received a master's degree in naval architecture from MIT, and was assigned to the Navy Construction Corps. McKee was assigned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard following graduation, and then transferred to the New London, Connecticut, submarine base in 1924. McKee became ship type assistant of submarine design for the Navy Bureau of Construction and Repair in Washington from 1926 to 1930, where he directed the design of USS Dolphin from which evolved the successful fleet submarines of World War II. McKee served as new construction superintendent at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 1930 to 1934 and as hull superintendent at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 1934 to 1938. In the latter post, he oversaw introduction of the all-welded pressure hull techniques pioneered while building USS Sturgeon. Captain McKee worked in submarine planning, design and construction as the Design Superintendent of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard from 1938 to 1945, and was awarded a Legion of Merit for his service there. His accomplishments at Portsmouth included receipt of a Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for participation in the rescue and salvage of USS Squalus in 1939, receipt of the Linnard Foundation award in 1940, and implementation the pressure hull improvements allowing Balao-class submarines to safely dive to 600 feet (180 m), rather than the nominal 300-foot (91 m) depth limitation for Gato-class submarines.

"Here's a question based on the provided sentence:

What is the main source of polysaccharides in root mucilage, according to growing evidence, and how do they contribute to forming relationships with soil-dwelling life forms?",47686993,"Root mucilage is made of plant-specific polysaccharides or long chains of sugar molecules. This polysaccharide secretion of root exudate forms a gelatinous substance that sticks to the caps of roots. Root mucilage is known to play a role in forming relationships with soil-dwelling life forms. Just how this root mucilage is secreted is debated, but there is growing evidence that mucilage derives from ruptured cells. As roots penetrate through the soil, many of the cells surrounding the caps of roots are continually shed and replaced. These ruptured or lysed cells release their component parts, which include the polysaccharides that form root mucilage. These polysaccharides come from the Golgi apparatus and plant cell wall, which are rich in plant-specific polysaccharides. Unlike animal cells, plant cells have a cell wall that acts as a barrier surrounding the cell providing strength, which supports plants just like a skeleton. This cell wall is used to produce everyday products such as timber, paper, and natural fabrics, including cotton. Root mucilage is a part of a wider secrete from plant roots known as root exudate. Plant roots secrete a variety of organic molecules into the surrounding soil, such as proteins, enzymes, DNA, sugars and amino acids, which are the building blocks of life. This collective secretion is known as root exudate. This root exudate prevents root infection from bacteria and fungi, helps the roots to penetrate through the soil, and can create a micro-climate that is beneficial to the plant.",0.445

What was the purpose of chartering the Paterson and Ramapo Railroad in 1841?,46815449," The Paterson and Ramapo Railroad was a railroad that operated mostly in New Jersey, connecting the city of and Paterson, New Jersey with Suffern, New York, just across the state line. The railroad was chartered in 1841 and construction began in 1847. It was created to form a connection between the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad, one of the earliest railroads in the United States, and the Erie Railroad in Suffern. The two Paterson railroads provided a shorter route from Suffern to New York City than did the New York and Erie Railroad. The road served freight customers from the beginning, notably cotton mills in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. Several other factories, including a paper mill, were built due to the railroad. The railroad opened in fall, 1849. The steam locomotives to operate on the line were ordered from Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works in Paterson. In 1852, the New York and Erie Railroad leased the track rights of the P&HR and P&R and made their lines the new New York and Erie Railroad mainline. It added a third rail to make a 6 ft (1,829 mm) track as well.",1.144
"What are the three stages that Alfons Vansteenwegen proposes relationships evolve through, starting from being ""in love"" to achieving a ""true partnership""?",5321994,"Alfons Vansteenwegen is one of the Flemish leading theoreticians and therapists in communication theory and important inspirator in the field of couple therapy and general psychotherapy. Alfons Vansteenwegen is a respected authority on couple differentiation, and he has proposed that relationships evolve through three stages: being in love, differentiation, and true partnership. In the falling in love period we see the other in an ideal way and that's because of fusion. Fusion means that we fall together in feelings, but the feelings are not yet the real relationship’. For couples struggling with low differentiation, Vansteenwegen offers valuable insights and approaches. Couples with low differentiation are usually not equipped to manage differentiation when it is experienced. For example, partners may differ in the way they feel about sex or the intimacy they desire. This can be an example of differentiation. Couples that are not prepared to manage differentiation may experience conflict. However, a couple that is equipped to manage differentiation will experience experience this as an opportunity for communication and negotiation rather than conflict. As Alfons Vansteenwegen ‘in Psychotherapy, sometimes you see the return of the desire after a good session where they learn new things about each other and where they felt very close in the feelings and experiences they have’. In addition to his contributions to couple therapy, Vansteenwegen has authored more than 10 books on the subject, which have been translated into numerous languages. One of his best-known works is The Good Enough Couple, which was most recently updated in 2019. He has also authored or co-authored nearly 400 clinical and scientific publications on topics such as marriage, family, and sexuality.",0.85
"What was Harry Dean's most impressive performance in first-class cricket, and what were his match figures in that game?",2921817,"Harry Dean was an English cricketer who played for Lancashire and England. Dean was a left-arm bowler who could bowl fast-medium swing or slower spinners to suit the conditions. Joining Lancashire in 1906, he made an immediate impact with 60 wickets in his first season. He took 100 wickets in 1907 but was expensive given that virtually all pitches suited spin bowling. However, by developing fast-medium swingers of a similar style to George Hirst as a dry-weather alternative to his slow-medium spinners, Dean improved steadily to be by 1910 clearly the best bowler in the Lancashire eleven with 137 wickets. In 1911, although he was overworked when Walter Brearley was away on business, Dean went from strength to strength, taking 175 wickets in the County Championship and being by 23 wickets the leading bowler in first-class cricket. In the six games he did partner Brearley, the two gave enough evidence that they could be formidable indeed: against Kent on a perfect wicket at Canterbury they got down eight wickets for 58 at the start and went on to take all twenty wickets in the match – Brearley twelve for 218, Dean eight for 144 – depriving Kent of a hat-trick of titles in the process. In 1912, now almost exclusively bowling spin, Dean was better than ever and in wet weather carried all before him, taking 13 for 49 against Worcestershire and fifteen wickets against Kent – both at Old Trafford. Dean played three times for England that summer in the 1912 Triangular Tournament – twice against South Africa and once against Australia. Though he bowled very well in these games, with four for nineteen on a sticky wicket in the decisive Test against Australia his high point, Dean was near retirement before the next home Tests were played and was never thought likely to do well abroad. In 1913, Dean was steady but rather expensive on the hard wickets, but on a rain-affected pitch in a special “Roses match” against Yorkshire arranged for the visit of King George V to the Aigburth ground at Liverpool, Dean accomplished one of the best performance in first-class cricket. He took nine wickets for 62 runs in the first innings, and eight for 29 in the second, and his match figures of 17 for 91 remain the best in a first-class match for Lancashire or against Yorkshire. In 1914, Dean was absent for most of the first half of the season, and did only one notable performance on returning when he took 13 for 84 against a strong Hampshire side, whilst he was very disappointing in 1919. However, he surprised the critics in 1920 with a superb season, taking over 120 wickets and with Lawrence Cook helping Lancashire to second spot. He bowled very well in 1921 even if helped by some appalling batting sides, but then switched to Cheshire in the Minor Counties Championship for the 1922 & 1923 seasons. After his retirement from playing cricket, he coached at Rossall School.",0.874

What factors contribute to the controversy surrounding tribal disenrollment in the United States, particularly with regards to the clash between individual and tribal rights?",50292543,"In the United States, tribal disenrollment is a process by which a Native American individual loses citizenship or the right to belong within a Native American tribe. Some native scholars have argued that although belonging in Native nations was historically a matter of kinship, it has become increasingly legalistic. Research found that nearly 80 tribes across 20 states have engaged in disenrollment as of 2016. While some tribal leaders assert that disenrollments are meant to correct tribal rolls and protect the integrity of the tribe, others argue that empirical data shows they are politically and economically motivated. Article 9 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states: ""Indigenous peoples and individuals have the right to belong to an indigenous community or nation, in accordance with the traditions and customs of the community or nation concerned."" No discrimination of any kind may arise from the exercise of such a right. Article 33 of that UN states that ""Indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own identity or membership in accordance with their customs and traditions."" Individual and tribal rights clash in the disenrollment context. In the United States, it is entirely up to the tribes to determine the criteria and procedures that an individual must meet and undergo to be considered for tribal membership. Most tribes do so pursuant to artificial tribal membership standards meted out by the U.S. Congress pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, most notably blood quantum. Between 1904 and 1919, tribal members of mixed African and Native American ancestry were disenrolled from the Chitimacha tribe of Louisiana, and their descendants have since then been denied tribal membership.",3.018
"What was the main factor that led to the decline and eventual ceasing of operations of Nedick's, an American fast-food chain that originated in New York City in 1913?",15088976,"Nedick's was an American chain of fast-food restaurants that originated in New York City in 1913. The name of the chain was formed from the last names of Robert T. Neely and Orville A.

During the 1950s the chain expanded to the Newark, New Jersey; Albany, New York; Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington, D.C. areas. Originally known for making and selling a signature orange drink, Nedick's expanded its menu through the years. Coffee, doughnuts and hot dogs, with a unique mustard relish in a toasted bun, were added to the Nedick's menu. The chain became known for the orange with white decor of its locations as well as the slogans ""Good food is never expensive at Nedick's"" and ""Always a pleasure"". Following intense competition in the 1970s from national chains including McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, and criticism in 1981 for the quality of its concession at the Central Park Zoo, Nedick's ceased operations.

"What are some of the reasons why conservationist organisations recognise specific battlefields as having historic or cultural significance, and what methods do they use to protect these sites from development that may threaten their historical integrity?",32102037,"Registered battlefields in the UK are battlefields recognised as having specific historic or cultural significance. They are recognised as such by conservationist organisations for a variety of reasons, including protecting them from development that may threaten historic buildings, items, or topography. The history relating to them is often hard to unravel, as there is often little to see above ground and the historical record is often biased in favour of the victors. The UK has many historic battlefield sites, some of which have legal protection through heritage protection legislation whilst others are protected through landscape legislation. More recently, some archaeologists prefer the term ""site of conflict"" to ""battlefield"", because of the difficulty in defining the geographical extent of a site. In England, the Register of Historic Battlefields lists the sites of 43 of the most important military battles on English soil. It was set up by English Heritage and since the organisations split it has been managed by Historic England as part of the National Heritage List for England. Historic Scotland is responsible for the Inventory of Historic Battlefields. There are currently 17 battlefields on the Inventory.

What was the original name of the electoral division that was replaced by the Division of Riverina-Darling in 1984?,2134425,"The Division of Riverina-Darling was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in south-west rural New South Wales, and included the towns of Broken Hill, Griffith, Hay and Narrandera. The Division was created in 1984, largely replacing the abolished division of Riverina. Its name indicated its relationship with Riverina and the seat of Darling, abolished in 1969. Riverina-Darling had a notional Labor majority on its creation. However, it included most of the old Riverina, and was thus a natural choice for that seat's member, Noel Hicks of the National Party, to transfer for the 1984 election. Hicks overcame the Labor majority to win in 1984, and continued to fend off spirited challenges from Labor until it was abolished in 1993. Broken Hill was transferred to Parkes, while most of its remaining territory became a recreated Riverina, which became a safe National seat as a result.",0.994

What is the primary mechanism by which a spark chamber detector makes a charged particle from a cosmic ray visible?,1025259,"A spark chamber is a particle detector: a device used in particle physics for detecting electrically charged particles. They were most widely used as research tools from the 1930s to the 1960s and have since been superseded by other technologies such as drift chambers and silicon detectors. Today, working spark chambers are mostly found in science museums and educational organisations, where they are used to demonstrate aspects of particle physics and astrophysics. Spark chambers consist of a stack of metal plates placed in a sealed box filled with a gas such as helium, neon or a mixture of the two. When a charged particle from a cosmic ray travels through the box, it ionises the gas between the plates. Ordinarily this ionisation would remain invisible. However, if a high enough voltage can be applied between each adjacent pair of plates before that ionisation disappears, then sparks can be made to form along the trajectory taken by the ray, and the cosmic ray in effect becomes visible as a line of sparks. In order to control when this voltage is applied, a separate detector is needed. When this trigger senses that a cosmic ray has just passed, it fires a fast switch to connect the high voltage to the plates. The high voltage cannot be connected to the plates permanently, as this would lead to arc formation and continuous discharging. As research devices, spark chamber detectors have lower resolution than bubble chamber detectors. However they can be made highly selective with the help of auxiliary detectors, making them useful in searching for very rare events.",2.549

What is the primary mechanism by which the brain initiates and controls the activation of schemas in routine situations, according to Norman and Shallice's model of executive functioning?",34820690,"Executive functions are a cognitive apparatus that controls and manages cognitive processes. Norman and Shallice (1980) proposed a model on executive functioning of attentional control that specifies how thought and action schemata become activated or suppressed for routine and non-routine circumstances. Schemas, or scripts, specify an individual's series of actions or thoughts under the influence of environmental conditions. Every stimulus condition turns on the activation of a response or schema. The initiation of appropriate schema under routine, well-learned situations is monitored by contention scheduling which laterally inhibits competing schemas for the control of cognitive apparatus. Under unique, non-routine procedures controls schema activation. The SAS is an executive monitoring system that oversees and controls contention scheduling by influencing schema activation probabilities and allowing for general strategies to be applied to novel problems or situations during automatic attentional processes.",3.923

What is the primary difference between a naval flight officer (NFO) and a pilot in the United States Navy or Marine Corps?,1029605,"A naval flight officer (NFO) is a commissioned officer in the United States Navy or United States Marine Corps who specializes in airborne weapons and sensor systems. NFOs are not pilots, but they may perform many ""co-pilot"" or ""mission specialist"" functions, depending on the type of aircraft. Until 1966, their duties were performed by both commissioned officer and senior enlisted naval aviation observers (NAO). In 1966, enlisted personnel were removed from naval aviation observer duties but continued to serve in enlisted aircrew roles, while NAO officers received the newly established NFO designation, and the NFO insignia was introduced. NFOs in the US Navy begin their careers as unrestricted line officers (URL), eligible for command at sea and ashore in the various naval aviation aircraft type/model/series (T/M/S) communities and, at a senior level, in command of carrier air wings and aircraft carriers afloat and functional air wings, naval air stations and other activities ashore. They are also eligible for promotion to senior flag rank positions, including command of aircraft carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups, joint task forces, numbered fleets, naval component commands and unified combatant commands. A small number of US Navy NFOs have later opted for a lateral transfer to the restricted line (RL) as aeronautical engineering duty officers (AEDO), while continuing to retain their NFO designation and active flight status. Such officers are typically graduates of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and/or the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School with advanced academic degrees in aerospace engineering or similar disciplines. AEDO/NFOs are eligible to command test and evaluation squadrons, naval air test centers, naval air warfare centers, and hold major program management responsibilities within the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). Similarly, Marine Corps NFOs are also considered eligible for command at sea and ashore within Marine aviation, and are also eligible to hold senior general officer positions, such as command of Marine aircraft wings, Marine air-ground task forces (MAGTFs), joint task forces, Marine expeditionary forces, Marine Corps component commands and unified combatant commands. The counterpart to the NFO in the United States Air Force is the combat systems officer (CSO), encompassing the previous roles of navigator, weapon systems officer and electronic warfare officer. Although NFOs in the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye aircraft perform functions similar to the USAF air battle manager in the E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft, their NFO training track is more closely aligned with that of USAF combat systems officers. The United States Coast Guard had a short-lived NFO community in the 1980s and 1990s when it operated E-2C Hawkeye aircraft on loan from the Navy. Following a fatal mishap with one of these aircraft at the former Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the Coast Guard returned the remaining E-2Cs to the Navy and disestablished its NFO program.",3.098

The library includes over a dozen boxes of the files of Herbert Yardley, declassified Enigma messages, technical reports, and books including how to crack the Data Encryption Standard using Deep Crack. The National Vigilance Park (NVP) was next to the museum, where three reconnaissance aircraft were displayed. A U.S. Army Beechcraft RU-8D Seminole reconnaissance plane represents the Army Airborne Signals Intelligence contribution in the Vietnam War. A Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport, modified to look like a reconnaissance-configured C-130A, memorialized a U.S. Air Force aircraft shot down over Soviet Armenia during the Cold War. Finally, the park also contained a U.S. Navy Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior, commemorating a mission in the Mediterranean on January 25, 1987, in which all seven crew members died. The NCM is open to the public, and admission is free. Donations to the NCM Foundation are accepted.

"Here's a question based on the given sentence:

What type of language was developed by RuleML to express both forward and backward rules in XML for deduction, rewriting, and inferential-transformational tasks?",1568414,"RuleML is a global initiative, led by a non-profit organization RuleML Inc., that is devoted to advancing research and industry standards design activities in the technical area of rules that are semantic and highly inter-operable. The standards design takes the form primarily of a markup language, also known as RuleML. The research activities include an annual research conference, the RuleML Symposium, also known as RuleML for short. Founded in fall 2000 by Harold Boley, Benjamin Grosof, and Said Tabet, RuleML was originally devoted purely to standards design, but then quickly branched out into the related activities of coordinating research and organizing an annual research conference starting in 2002. The M in RuleML is sometimes interpreted as standing for Markup and Modeling. The markup language was developed to express both forward (bottom-up) and backward (top-down) rules in XML for deduction, rewriting, and further inferential-transformational tasks. It is defined by the Rule Markup Initiative, an open network of individuals and groups from both industry and academia that was formed to develop a canonical Web language for rules using XML markup and transformations from and to other rule standards/systems. Markup standards and initiatives related to RuleML include: Rule Interchange Format (RIF): The design and overall purpose of W3C's Rule Interchange Format (RIF) industry standard is based primarily on the RuleML industry standards design. Like RuleML, RIF embraces a multiplicity of potentially useful rule dialects that nevertheless share common characteristics.
RuleML Technical Committee from Oasis-Open: An industry standards effort devoted to legal automation utilizing RuleML.
Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL): An industry standards design, based primarily on an early version of RuleML, whose development was funded in part by the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program.
Semantic Web Services Framework, particularly its Semantic Web Services Language: An industry standards design, based primarily on a medium-mature version of RuleML, whose development was funded in part by the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program and the WSMO research effort of the EU.
Mathematical Markup Language (MathML): However, MathML's Content Markup is better suited for defining functions rather than relations or general rules
Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML): With this XML-based language one can define and share various models for data-mining results, including association rules
Attribute Grammars in XML (AG-markup): For AG's semantic rules, there are various possible XML markups that are similar to Horn-rule markup
Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT): This is a restricted term-rewriting system of rules, written in XML, for transforming XML documents into other text documents",1.843

"What was the reason behind Frederick II of Austria's refusal to allow Vladislaus III to marry Gertrude, his niece?",10049840,"Vladislaus III, also called Vladislaus Henry III, was the margrave of Moravia and duke of Austria from 1246 until 1247. Vladislaus was born around 1227. A member of the Přemyslid dynasty, he was the eldest son and heir of Wenceslaus I, King of Bohemia, and his wife Kunigunde, daughter of Philip of Swabia, King of Germany. His younger brother was the latter King Ottokar II. He was named after his uncle and great uncle, who were also margraves of Moravia. When his other uncle, Přemysl, died in 1239, Wenceslaus took control of Moravia. In 1246, he appointed Vladislaus margrave. Pope Innocent IV wrote a letter to Vladislaus on 24 November 1246 concerning the activity of the papal collector Gotfryd. As Duke Frederick II of Austria was without a male heir, Wenceslaus sought to acquire the Duchy of Austria by arranging the marriage of Vladislaus with the late duke's niece Gertrude, daughter of Duke Henry II of Mödling, second son of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Frederick was forced to consent to this arrangement under duress. In 1246, however, Frederick reneged, alleging that the couple was related within the prohibited degree. Wenceslaus obtained a dispensation from the pope. The wedding took place after Frederick's death later that year. He was recognized as duke and is so titled in contemporary Austrian sources. He received the homage of the Austrian nobility, but died suddenly on 3 January 1247, before he could take possession of the duchy. His death was most likely natural. He had no children in his short marriage. According to the Anonymous Austrian Chronicle: The Annals of Prague give substantially the same account: Vladislaus was succeeded in Moravia by his younger brother, who soon rebelled against their father. After his death, she married Prince Roman Danylovych. As a result, central Europe was plunged into the War of the Babenberg Succession.",3.938

From the Homeric Hymn to Selene, we have: ""Once the Son of Cronos [Zeus] was joined with her [Selene] in love; and she conceived and bare a daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods."" An Athenian tradition perhaps made Pandia the wife of Antiochus, the eponymous hero of Antiochis, one of the ten Athenian tribes (phylai). Originally Pandia may have been an epithet of Selene, but by at least the time of the late Homeric Hymn, Pandia had become a daughter of Zeus and Selene.

"Here's a question based on the given sentence:

What is unique about a simple spirolateral that completes in one turn compared to those that require more than one turn?",67378893,"In Euclidean geometry, a spirolateral is a polygon created by a sequence of fixed vertex internal angles and sequential edge lengths 1,2,3,...,n which repeat until the figure closes. The number of repeats needed is called its cycles. A simple spirolateral has only positive angles. A simple spiral approximates of a portion of an archimedean spiral. A general spirolateral allows positive and negative angles. A spirolateral which completes in one turn is a simple polygon, while requiring more than 1 turn is a star polygon and must be self-crossing. A simple spirolateral can be an equangular simple polygon <p> with p vertices, or an equiangular star polygon <p/q> with p vertices and q turns. Spirolaterals were invented and named by Frank C. Odds as a teenager in 1962, as square spirolaterals with 90° angles, drawn on graph paper. In 1970, Odds discovered triangular and hexagonal spirolateral, with 60° and 120° angles, can be drawn on isometric (triangular) graph paper. Odds wrote to Martin Gardner who encouraged him to publish the results in Mathematics Teacher in 1973. The process can be represented in turtle graphics, alternating turn angle and move forward instructions, but limiting the turn to a fixed rational angle. The smallest golygon is a spirolateral, 790°4, made with 7 right angles, and length 4 follow concave turns. Golygons are different in that they must close with a single sequence 1,2,3,..n, while a spirolateral will repeat that sequence until it closes.",2.645

"What is the molecular formula of sibiricine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Corydalis crispa?",40385399,"Sibiricine is a bioactive isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Corydalis crispa (Fumariaceae), which is a Bhutanese medicinal plant from the Himalayas. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, the molecular formula of sibiricine is determined to be C20H17NO6. The IUPAC name for sibiricine is 8'-hydroxy-6-methylspiro[7,8-dihydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline-5,7'-8H-cyclopenta[g][1,3]benzodioxole]-6'-one. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (PMR) spectrum of sibiricine at 100 MHz shows that sibiricine is structurally related to ochrobirine and ochotensine. With the exception of sibiricine, 8 other alkaloids are extracted by investigating Corydalis crispa. These isoquinoline alkaloids are protopine, 13-oxoprotopine, 13-oxocryptopine, stylopine, coreximine, rheagenine, ochrobirine, and bicuculline.",3.11
"What was the reason behind the restoration of the Meiktila War Cemetery in 2012, according to the text?",40662385,"The Meiktila War Cemetery is a war cemetery which serves as the resting places for captured Ottoman soldiers who died in Myanmar. It is located in the city of Meiktila, situated in the Meiktila District of the Mandalay Division. The cemetery also serves as a memorial for the deceased soldiers. During the First World War, approximately 12,000 Ottoman soldiers were captured by the British during the Mesopotamian and Sinai and Palestine campaigns as part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. These prisoners of war were mostly transferred to prisoner-of-war camps in Myanmar, which was under British colonial rule at the time. Up to 1,000 Ottoman prisoners of war died while in captivity, primarily due to outbreaks of disease. During the war, the prisoner-of-war camp in Meiktila housed thousands of Ottoman prisoners of war. According to a Red Cross report published in 1917, the prisoners reported that they were treated well in the camps but complained about being separated from their families, loss of their liberty and livelihoods and boredom. The Red Cross characterized the prisoners acceptance of their fate as ""Oriental fatalism"". After the end of the First World War, most of the prisoners-of-war were sent back home. The cemetery in Meiktila where the soldiers were buried soon fell into disrepair, though in 2012 the Turkish government paid for it to be restored in order to serve as a memorial (after Turkish-Myanmar relations began to improve under the presidency of Thein Sein. In 2013, Islamophobic rumors spread in the Mandalay region that after the cemetery was restored, a mosque would constructed nearby, which were denied by a local Muslim community leader.

A) Lack of snow
B) Limited popularity of long-distance mushing outside North America
C) Difficulty in fundraising and obtaining sponsors for the race
D) High cost of flying a dog team from Alaska to Italy

Answer: C) Difficulty in fundraising and obtaining sponsors for the race",21729604,"The Alpirod is a defunct 1,000 kilometres (621 mi) sled dog stage race in Southern Europe. Its name comes from a combination of the Alps, where the race took place, and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, upon which the race was based. The competition consisted of a 14-day stage race in 11 cities in four countries: Italy, Germany, Austria and France. The competition consisted of multiple short races separated by evening breaks, similar to cycling's Tour de France. At the time, it was the largest sled dog race outside North America. The race was organized by Armen Khatchikian, an Italian Iditarod competitor who hoped to bring a form of that race to Europe. It first took place in 1988, and the inaugural race was won by Alaska racer Joe Runyan. In 1989, the race was won by Kathy Swenson. She was the first woman to win the race. In 1990, Alaskan Roxy Wright Champaine won the race, becoming the third American winner. In 1992, the race was won by Nenana, Alaska musher Jacques Philip, who went on to win the race three times. Despite its initial success, it soon ran into difficulties. Fundraising and obtaining sponsors for the race proved difficult, and the competition was hampered by a lack of snow. In addition, the limited popularity of long-distance mushing outside North America crippled participation, as did the £10,000 cost to fly a dog team from Alaska to Italy. These factors caused the race to be shortened to 700 kilometres (435 mi) in the early 1990s and shortened again to fewer than 500 kilometres (311 mi) for the 1994 race. Prior to the 1996 race, the competition's primary sponsor, dog food manufacturer Royal Canin, ended its support of the competition and organizers announced its cancellation. Despite hopes that the race would find a new title sponsor to support its $150,000 purse, no sponsor emerged. The Alpirod was a pioneer in the use of dog microchip identification, requiring it several years before the Yukon Quest or Iditarod made the process mandatory. The unofficial successor to the Alpirod is the AlpenTrail, a 300 kilometres (186 mi) sled dog race in the Alps started by several of the Alpirod's organizers.",1.074

It is a powdered nutritional supplement that contains 3 grams of calcium β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, 14 grams of L-arginine, and 14 grams of L-glutamine per two daily servings. Juven has been shown to increase lean body mass during clinical trials in individuals with AIDS and cancer, but not rheumatoid cachexia. Clinical trials with Juven for AIDS have also demonstrated improvements in immune status, as measured by a reduced HIV viral load relative to controls and higher CD3+ and CD8+ cell counts. The efficacy of Juven for the treatment of cancer cachexia was also examined in a phase 3 clinical trial which found a strong trend for an improvement in lean body mass relative to controls; however, according to the authors of the trial itself and a systematic review that included it, the trial did not adequately test the ability of Juven to prevent or reverse the loss of lean body mass in individuals with cancer cachexia since the majority of participants did not complete the study. Further research involving the treatment of cancer cachexia with Juven over a period of several months is required to adequately determine treatment efficacy.",2.719

What is the current population of Westerhope based on the 2011 Census?,5693896,"Westerhope is an area in the west of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It was founded to provide housing for working families with sufficient land to grow vegetables. Westerhope expanded substantially in Victorian times with the discovery of workable coal reserves. It was also formerly a ward of the city council until 2018, which had a population of 9,196 at the 2011 Census. The coal reserves have now been largely exhausted and the two pits - Coronation & North Walbottle - have long since closed. After the extraction of 21.5 million tons of coal, the North Walbottle pit was closed in 1968 as further coal extraction would have risked undermining the runway of Newcastle airport, which lies about 5 miles to the North. With the westward expansion of Newcastle upon Tyne, Westerhope was incorporated into the city as part of the 1974 local government reorganisation. This coincided with large owner-occupied housing estates - Chapel House, Chapel Park, St John's - being developed on the west of Westerhope. At one time these were claimed to be the largest such developments in Europe, although the source of such claims is unclear. Additionally a substantial social housing development, Newbiggin Hall Estate was built at around the same time to the North of the village. Due to road developments, Westerhope lies in a favourable transport location, in the crook of the A1/A69 junction. This gives good communications to the West, North & South. In contrast, because of the hilly nature of the land, Westerhope has been excluded from the Tyne and Wear Metro system and public transport links to the city centre rely on buses. Additionally, a dual carriageway links the north side of the village to the airport. Westerhope is now largely a dormitory to Newcastle city, although some light industry exists around the Cobblers Corner area, which is the historic core of the village.",1.144

What is a notable difference between town signs in Germany and Austria compared to those in the United States?,12769256,"A town sign or city limit sign is a road sign placed at the side of the road or street at the boundary of the territory of a city, town, or village. Town signs may be placed for reading both by drivers entering the town and, in a different format, by those exiting it. Signs give the name of the town in the local official languages, and sometimes in other languages. In some countries, town signs are also an essential part of the traffic law, for example by defining the speed limit within the town's territory. In some countries, such as Germany and Austria, signs aren't placed at the exact boundary of a city or town, but rather at the location where the settlement's built-up area begins and ends. In the United Kingdom, town sign may refer to a prominent, decorative, often carved sign, commemorating the values and history of the town. Synonymous with Village sign; Commonly in the centre of the town. In much of the United States, there is a similar county sign at the boundary between each county, indicating the county being entered and often the one being left. Even if not done within a given U.S. state, there is also nearly always a welcome sign at the state line on every major highway, and most any other road. The welcome signs on Interstate highways are usually very large and have graphics, and may have an attached text-only sign directing motorists to the welcome center at a rest area. On smaller roads, they are usually more similar to town signs, showing the state and county, often with other signs indicating speed limit, a state law, and/or a change in time zone.",1.158

What is the primary method that the western blue-tongued lizard uses to deter predators or threats when it feels threatened?,9627812,"The western blue-tongued lizard, also known as the western blue-tongued skink, is a large skink native to Australia. It is one of six species of blue-tongued skinks found in Australia, though further species are found in New Guinea and Indonesia. The western blue-tongued lizard grows to around 45 cm (18 in) in length. It has a brown, banded pattern across the body and tail; the underside of the body is usually pale. It has distinctive black markings to the rear of each eye. The body is wide and large in comparison to the size of the legs. As its name suggests, it has a blue tongue, which contrasts with the pink interior of its mouth. When threatened, it may open its mouth and stick out its tongue in a threat display. If the initial display is unsuccessful, and the predator or threat does not retreat, it may hiss and flatten out its body in an attempt to make itself look bigger. ... It is diurnal, hunting for insects, spiders, and snails, and foraging for plants and carrion. It is not an agile lizard, so its prey tends to be slow-moving. It has powerful jaws which allow it break up snail shells and the exoskeletons of beetles. It is found in grasslands, dunes, shrublands, and sparse woodlands. It rests under leaf litter or rocks at night, and sometimes uses abandoned rabbit burrows for shelter. Blue-tongued lizards are popular pets and can live for up to 30 years in captivity, though the western blue-tongued lizard is extremely uncommon as a pet, as it is one of the rarer species. They give birth to approximately 5 live young. The young consume the placental membrane immediately after birth, and are precocious and disperse after a few days. They have bands of yellow and brown on their bodies and tails. The western blue-tongued lizard is found chiefly in Western Australia. It is restricted to the far south in the Northern Territory, and divided into an eastern and western population in South Australia. It is listed as ""Near Threatened"" in Victoria, where it is restricted to the north, and ""Threatened"" in New South Wales, where it exists as a population to the southwest and in a pocket in the centre of the state. Threats to the species include predation by introduced species such as the red fox and domestic cat, clearance of habitat for agriculture, and destruction of the rabbit warrens used for shelter.",2.765

What is the significance of November 11th on Święty Marcin street in Poznań?,25230805,"Święty Marcin, in full ulica Święty Marcin, is a main central street in the city of Poznań in western Poland. It runs from south of the old town district, westwards past the church of St. Martin of Tours from which it takes its name, past the ""Zamek"", to Adam Mickiewicz Square, and finally to University Bridge (Most Uniwersytecki), by which it crosses the railway line and leads to the roundabout called Rondo Kaponiera. On Adam Mickiewicz square is a statue of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, as well as a monument to the victims of the Poznań popular protests of 1956. On the left of the square are the central buildings of Adam Mickiewicz University. Trams run along most of the length of the street, from Rondo Kaponiera to Aleje Karola Marcinkowskiego, in both directions at the western end, and eastwards only east of Gwarna. The area around St. Martin's church was originally a separate settlement outside the medieval walled city of Poznań. It was brought within the city boundaries in 1797, at the beginning of the period of Prussian rule, and the street began to be laid out soon after that. It was named St. Martin Strasse in German. Following the building of the 19th-century fortifications around Poznań, the street led to the Berlin Gate, the main western entrance to the city. The imperial palace and other grand buildings in its vicinity were built following the demolition of this fortified line in the early 20th century. In the communist period the street was renamed ulica Armii Czerwonej, meaning ""Red Army Street"". On St. Martin's Day, 11 November, a parade passes along this street, from St. Martin's Church to the Imperial Castle, where a fair and entertainments take place. Saint Martin's croissant, widely known for its delicious taste, is traditionally baked in Poznań for this day and sold also in other cities in Poland. ",1.461
"What is the earliest known geometrically-shaped earthwork in North America that William Romain's research identified, and where is it located?",47551923,"William Francis Romain is an American archaeologist, archaeoastronomer, and author. William Romain received his Ph.D. in archaeology from the University of Leicester and M.A. and B.A. degrees in anthropology from Kent State University. He specializes in the study of ancient religions, cognitive archaeology, and archaeoastronomy. William Romain is a Research Associate with the Indiana University, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Assistant Editor for the Journal of Astronomy in Culture. He serves on the editorial board of the Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology and is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and The Explorers Club. Romain has served as an advisor to the Board of Trustees for the Heartland Earthworks Conservancy, as well as Research Associate with the Indiana University, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and Newark Earthworks Center at Ohio State University. He is a recipient of the Archaeological Society of Ohio's Robert Converse award for Outstanding Contributions to Ohio Archaeology. William Romain is a licensed private pilot and holds certification in marine celestial navigation. He has conducted archaeoastronomic fieldwork in the Eastern United States, China, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar (Burma). In 2011 Romain led a team of archaeologists in an investigation of Serpent Mound, in Adams County, Ohio. This was the first major investigation of the effigy in more than one hundred years and included Geoprobe coring, hand coring, limited excavation, ground-penetrating radar, and electric resistivity analysis. Among the results were new radiocarbon dates for the effigy suggesting it was built about 2,300 years ago by people of the Early Woodland period. Other work has included archaeoastronomic assessments for Poverty Point and Watson Brake in Louisiana, Mound City in Ohio, the Newark Earthworks, Great Hopewell Road in Ohio, and Cahokia in Illinois. Most recently William Romain has published new archaeoastronomic findings for Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Great Ziggurat of Ur in Iraq, Xanadu in Inner Mongolia, and the Jokhang, Samye, and Tradruk temples in Tibet. Romain's research identified multiple solstice alignments at Poverty Point and Watson Brake. Watson Brake is the earliest known geometrically-shaped earthwork in North America. At Cahokia in Illinois, Romain showed how Rattlesnake Causeway and Rattlesnake Mound were likely associated with the Milky Way Path of Souls and how orientation to the Milky Way likely accounts for the site's peculiar 5-degree skew from true north. Research at Angkor identified multiple solstice alignments for Angkor Wat and more than a dozen surrounding temples. Also proposed were geomantic and archaeoastronomic explanations for the location of Angkor Wat and Rong Chen temple. At Ur, in Mesopotamia, Romain found that not only is the Great Ziggurat lunar-aligned - but the entire city is lunar aligned. Research at Xanadu in Inner Mongolia showed how the summer palace for Kublai Khan was situated and oriented with respect to feng shui concepts and the winter and summer solstices. Research in Tibet provided explanations for the locations and orientations the Jokhang, Samye and Tradruk temples and showed how the emperors' tombs in the Chongye Valley were oriented to selected mountains having legendary importance. Most recently Romain has documented the probable location and celestial alignments for the St. Louis Mound Group in St. Louis, Missouri. This group of 25 mounds located across the Mississippi River from Cahokia was leveled in the 1800s as a result of urban development. ",2.005
"What is the primary purpose of a heartbeat mechanism in mission-critical systems, and how does it contribute to providing high availability and fault tolerance?",38838486,"In computer science, a heartbeat is a periodic signal generated by hardware or software to indicate normal operation or to synchronize other parts of a computer system. Heartbeat mechanism is one of the common techniques in mission critical systems for providing high availability and fault tolerance of network services by detecting the network or systems failures of nodes or daemons which belongs to a network cluster—administered by a master server—for the purpose of automatic adaptation and rebalancing of the system by using the remaining redundant nodes on the cluster to take over the load of failed nodes for providing constant services. Usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular interval in the order of seconds; a heartbeat message. If the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat for a time—usually a few heartbeat intervals—the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed. Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a periodic or recurring basis from the originator's start-up until the originator's shutdown. When the destination identifies a lack of heartbeat messages during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that the originator has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available.",1.173

"What is the relationship between the self-linking number and the linking number, and how does the choice of framing affect the calculation of the self-linking number?",12452932,"In knot theory, the self-linking number is an invariant of framed knots. It is related to the linking number of curves. A framing of a knot is a choice of a non-zero non-tangent vector at each point of the knot. More precisely, a framing is a choice of a non-zero section in the normal bundle of the knot, i.e. a (non-zero) normal vector field. Given a framed knot C, the self-linking number is defined to be the linking number of C with a new curve obtained by pushing points of C along the framing vectors. Given a Seifert surface for a knot, the associated Seifert framing is obtained by taking a tangent vector to the surface pointing inwards and perpendicular to the knot. The self-linking number obtained from a Seifert framing is always zero. The blackboard framing of a knot is the framing where each of the vectors points in the vertical (z) direction. The self-linking number obtained from the blackboard framing is called the Kauffman self-linking number of the knot. This is not a knot invariant because it is only well-defined up to regular isotopy.",2.044

In October 1868 he became a medical student at University College Hospital. There he won the Liston Gold Medal for 1875. In 1876 under the supervision of Marcus Beck, he started a descriptive catalogue of the University College Hospital's preparations of surgical pathology. In December 1881, Samuel George Betty was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, but he then changed his name to Samuel George Shattock, giving as a reason that the Shattock side of his family seemed likely to suffer extinction and the change might preserve the family name. S. G. Shattock worked on pathology and never registered as a medical practitioner. In 1878 as the successor to Cossar Ewart, Shattock was appointed Curator of the Anatomical and Pathological Museum at University College Hospital. In 1884 he was appointed Curator of the Museum at St Thomas's Hospital, holding this post until his death in 1924. At St Thomas's Hospital he was appointed Lecturer on Pathology in the Medical School and later at the University of London, Professor of Pathology in the University of London, continuing in those two posts until he died in 1924. Shattock taught surgical pathology using typical museum specimens and in 1895 he gave a pioneering course of practical demonstrations in bacteriology. In addition to his regular work, he was often called upon to give a definitive opinion on morbid specimens sent from various locations in the British Empire. He was a pioneer of palaeopathology. On 4 April 1905 he exhibited a prehistoric or predynastic urinary calculus found in Egypt by G. Elliot Smith.

What is unique about the Rio Grande de Buba's environment compared to other estuaries in West Africa?,39477859,"The Rio Grande de Buba, also called the Rio Buba, Rio Grande, and Grande River, is an estuary of West Africa that is entirely contained within Guinea-Bissau, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. It is about 54 kilometres (34 mi) in total length and is 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) wide at its mouth. It is an environment unique in West Africa, which has no other example of an arm of the sea extending so far inland, with a downstream depth of around 30 metres (98 ft), and its fauna is extremely rich and diversified. The Grande was commercially important in the late 16th century, but this soon changed: ""Biafada and Mandinka traders along the Geba River and the Papel of Bissau greatly benefited from the precipitous decline of Grande River trade as Bijago raiders increasingly disrupted Biafada and lançado commerce and terrorized Biafada communities along the river.""",2.069

"What was John W. Jones' primary goal in recreating scenes from Confederate banknotes as large color paintings, and what method did he use to recreate these images?",23520116,"John W. Jones is an American artist who first gained acclaim for his series ""Confederate Currency: The Color of Money."" Self-taught and drafted into the U.S. Army in 1970, he served in Vietnam, eventually becoming an Army illustrator. Examining Confederate banknotes, he became interested in the depiction of the slave economy in the American South before and during the American Civil War. Banknotes of the era often depicted slaves as happy workers on the cotton plantations. Jones has said he intends to demonstrate that banknotes served a propaganda purpose in depicting slavery as a natural state of affairs and one on which the Southern states' economies rested. Jones recreated these scenes in large color paintings, using models and posing them as in the original etched images. He exhibits his paintings next to the banknote with the original etching. More recently, he has created a series of paintings, ""Lowcountry Gullah Series.""

What was the primary goal of the World Diamond Council when it was established in July 2000?",892273,"The World Diamond Council is an organization representing the entire diamond value chain including representatives from diamond mining, manufacturing, trading and retail. The council was established in July 2000. The purpose was to create a system to keep the supply chain of diamonds as free as possible from conflict diamonds. In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The KPCS document sets out the requirements for controlling rough diamond production and trade. The KPCS entered into force in 2003, when participating countries started to implement its rules. The KPCS is credited as being instrumental toward dramatically reducing “conflict diamonds” to less than 1% of the world's diamond production today. The World Diamond Council has representation on all the Kimberley Process's working groups and is influential in determining its implementation and future reform. The council was set up in July 2000 in Antwerp, Belgium after a joint meeting of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB), representing all the world's significant diamond trading centres, and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association (IDMA), representing significant manufacturers. The founding president was Eli Izhakoff, who served in the position until July 2013. Charter members are the WFDB, the IDMA and International Confederation of Jewellers (CIBJO).

"What are the main differences between formulary apportionment (also known as unitary taxation) and separate entity accounting, and how do they approach assigning prices for transactions within a multinational corporation?",30086263,"Formulary apportionment, also known as unitary taxation, is a method of splitting the total pre-tax profit earned by a multinational between the tax jurisdictions where it does business. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with other parts of the corporation or group to be assigned according to the arm's length standard commonly used in transfer pricing. In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes a portion of a multinational's total worldwide profit to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction. When applied to a corporate group, formulary apportionment requires combined reporting of the group's results. The parent and all of its subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity, and the method is then also known as worldwide unitary taxation. In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes ""overseas business organization"", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents.",3.597

This field is of relevance to nanotechnology in its quest for nanoscale electronic components and also to biology where many biochemical functions are based on molecular shuttles. Academic interest also exists for synthetic molecular shuttles, the first prototype reported in 1991 based on a rotaxane. This device is based on a molecular thread composed of an ethyleneglycol chain interrupted by two arene groups acting as so-called stations. The terminal units on this wire are bulky triisopropylsilyl groups. The bead is a tetracationic cyclophane based on two bipyridine groups and two para-phenylene groups. The bead is locked to one of the stations by pi-pi interactions but since the activation energy for migration from one station to the other station is only 13 kcal/mol the bead shuttles between them. The stoppers prevent the bead from slipping from the thread. Chemical synthesis of this device is based on molecular self-assembly from a preformed thread and two bead fragments.

"What restrictions did Italy impose on the Independent State of Croatia, leading to the formation of the Croatian Naval Legion, which fought as part of the German Navy?",14220876," The Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, was the navy of the Independent State of Croatia, an Axis puppet state controlled by the fascist Ustaše party. The NDH was created from parts of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 10 April 1941, four days after the World War II invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers commenced. The RMNDH consisted of two commands, the Coast and Maritime Traffic Command, and the River and River Traffic Command, and had its headquarters in the NDH capital, Zagreb. The Coast and Maritime Traffic Command consisted of three naval commands along the Adriatic coast, which were each divided into a number of naval districts. The naval districts consisted mainly of naval and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and customs duties. The River and River Traffic Command consisted of seven river stations, a naval infantry battalion, and a River Command Flotilla built around two former Yugoslav river monitors, which had been scuttled during the invasion but subsequently refloated. The RMNDH was only a small part of the armed forces of the NDH, largely due to restrictions imposed by Italy under the Treaties of Rome. To avoid these limitations, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, including the light cruiser Dalmacija, the former Yugoslav torpedo boat T7, and the Malinska-class mining tender Mosor. All of the significant assets had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.",6.236

On the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement the loss from the exercise is accounted for by noting the difference between the market price of the shares and the cash received, the exercise price, for issuing those shares through the option. Opponents of considering options an expense say that the real loss – due to the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares – is already stated on the cash flow statement.

What were some common misconceptions about Neo-Latin writing that scholars had to challenge, and how did studying Neo-Latin help reveal subtler relationships between languages?",73536660,"Neo-Latin studies is the study of Latin and its literature from the Italian Renaissance to the present day. Neo-Latin is important for understanding early modern European culture and society, including the development of literature, science, religion and vernacular languages. The study of Neo-Latin began to gain momentum as a specific topic in the 1970s. The International Association for Neo-Latin Studies was founded in 1971, leading to a series of conferences. The first major guide to the field appeared in 1977. While the topic is reasonably easy to define, the result is a very wide topic, covering many centuries, different subject matter and a very wide geographical spread, creating significant challenges for methodology. Nevertheless, the literature is often some of the most significant output of the period: Study of Neo-Latin is necessarily cross-disciplinary and requires Latinists to engage with audiences who are unfamiliar with Latin and the extent of contributions in Latin to their own fields, which are usually untranslated and untranscribed. Part of the work of the field is to make texts accessible, and translated, and another is to help non-Latinists to engage with the material and where necessary to challenge misconceptions about the nature of Latin writing in the period. Such misconceptions include the longevity of the relevance Latin, which is typically underestimated, the ""derivative"" nature of Neo-Latin writing, or that it competed, in direct opposition, with vernaculars. Neo-Latin studies help reveal subtler relationships between languages, through promotion of standardisation and cross fertilisation through introducing new models of genre, for example. The relevance of Neo-Latin studies to other areas of enquiry can be said to decline after 1800, when Latin has become much more marginal to the production of knowledge in Europe.",3.502

"What was the significance of using iron pigments exclusively in ceramic vessels, according to King Yeongjo's decree in 1754, with one notable exception?",33311368,"A dragon jar, also known as cloud-dragon jar, is a type of ceremonial porcelain vessel that became popular among the ruling classes of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910). They are decorated with large dragons against a background of stylized clouds, painted with underglaze pigments. In addition to being a generally auspicious symbol, the dragon represented the authority and beneficence of the ruler. In 1754, King Yeongjo decreed that iron pigments were to be used exclusively, except for jars having a dragon design. Because of the scarcity of the traditional cobalt blue pigment, which was imported from Muslim Turkestan, and was also known as “Mohammedan blue”, an underglaze brown iron oxide pigment was also used between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.",1.006

"What are the three types of cone photoreceptors in the eye, according to Hermann von Helmholtz's development of the Young-Helmholtz theory, and how do their responses to different wavelengths of light give rise to the phenomenological experience of color?",3746043,"The Young–Helmholtz theory, also known as the trichromatic theory, is a theory of trichromatic color vision – the manner in which the visual system gives rise to the phenomenological experience of color. In 1802, Young postulated the existence of three types of photoreceptors in the eye, with different but overlapping response to different wavelengths of visible light. Hermann von Helmholtz developed the theory further in 1850: that the three types of cone photoreceptors could be classified as short-preferring (violet), middle-preferring (green), and long-preferring (red), according to their response to the wavelengths of light striking the retina. The relative strengths of the signals detected by the three types of cones are interpreted by the brain as a visible color. For instance, yellow light uses different proportions of red and green, but little blue, so any hue depends on a mix of all three cones, for example, a strong red-sensitive, medium green-sensitive, and low blue-sensitive. Moreover, the intensity of colors can be changed without changing their hues, since intensity depends on the frequency of discharge to the brain, as a blue-green can be brightened but retain the same hue. The system is not perfect, as it does not distinguish yellow from a red-green mixture, but can powerfully detect subtle environmental changes.
In 1857, James Clerk Maxwell used the recently developed linear algebra to offer a mathematical proof of the Young–Helmholtz theory. The existence of cells sensitive to three different wavelength ranges was first shown in 1956 by Gunnar Svaetichin. In 1983 it was validated in human retinas in an experiment by Herbert Dartnall, James Bowmaker, and John Mollon, who obtained microspectrophotopic readings of single eye cone cells. Earlier evidence for the theory had been obtained by looking at light reflected from the retinas of living humans, and absorption of light by retinal cells removed from corpses. While Young is often credited as the progenitor of trichromatic color theory, a theory of color vision by George Palmer is mostly analogous to Young's, but precedes it by a quarter century. In his Theory of Colors and Vision (1777) and later in his Theory of Light (1786), Palmer claims that the retina has 3 classes of particles that selectively absorb red, yellow and blue rays. The unequal motion of these particles evokes color, and the equal motion thereof evokes white. However, Palmer also claimed that light itself is compounded of only three distinct rays: red, yellow and blue, which differs from the modern understanding, that light is a continuous visible spectrum.",6.311
"Here's a question based on the provided text:

What is the likelihood of a Young-Madders syndrome case being fatal in the prenatal stage, according to the text?",41742229,"Young–Madders syndrome, alternatively known as Pseudotrisomy 13 syndrome or holoprosencephaly–polydactyly syndrome, is a genetic disorder resulting from defective and duplicated chromosomes which result in holoprosencephaly, polydactyly, facial malformations and intellectual disability, with a significant variance in the severity of symptoms being seen across known cases. Many cases often suffer with several other genetic disorders, and some have presented with hypoplasia, cleft lip, cardiac lesions and other heart defects. In one case in 1991 and another in 2000 the condition was found in siblings who were the product of incest. Many cases are diagnosed prenatally and often in siblings. Cases are almost fatal in the prenatal stage with babies being stillborn. Though it is now thought that earlier cases were misdiagnosed as other genetic disorders with similar pathology—such as Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome—the earliest publicised recognition of the condition as a new, hitherto unclassified, genetic disorder was made by two British doctors in Leicester in 1987. Though they identified the condition, later named for them, they did not identify the genetic anomalies responsible but suspected a link with trisomy 13 due to the similar symptoms. With only one or two occurrences documented towards the end of the decade, a group of eight doctors published a five-patient case-study in 1991 which identified the likely chromosomal factors that caused the condition, similar to but distinct from trisomy 13, and gave it the name 'holoprosencephaly–polydactyly syndrome' based on its two most prolific presenting conditions. Later research showed that the condition could manifest in patients with normal karyotypes, without duplication of the chromosomes, and the most recent genetic research implicates problems with the gene code FBXW11 as a likely cause.",6.312

"What were four aspects of the Political Appointments System appointments that received widespread criticism, and what was Donald Tsang's response to this criticism?",17964087,"The Political Appointments System is a scheme introduced in 2008 by the Hong Kong Government to reinforce its ministerial team by superseding the Principal Officials Accountability System and inserting two layers of politically appointed officials below the secretaries, who are political appointees. These appointees report only to the secretaries, but not the permanent secretaries, the highest-ranking civil servants. The appointment of undersecretaries and political assistants is an extension of the previous RPAS that was initially confined to principal officials. Prior to the introduction, there were 14 political appointees—3 Secretaries of Departments and 11 Directors of Bureaux. The 24 newly created non-civil-service positions under this system comprise 11 undersecretaries and 13 political assistants. All the posts were created, ostensibly to work closely with bureau secretaries and top civil servants to implement the Chief Executive's policy blueprint and agenda in an executive-led government. Eight new undersecretaries were named on 20 May, and nine political assistant appointments were announced on 22 May 2008. There was widespread criticism of four aspects of the appointments: the nationality, salary, experience of appointees, and the transparency of the recruitment process. The government admitted that ""the announcements were poorly handled"". Donald Tsang was forced to make a grudging apology.

Of his works, the organ pieces are the most important: influenced by Dieterich Buxtehude and Johann Adam Reincken, Lübeck composed technically and artistically sophisticated works, with frequent virtuosic passages for pedal, five-voice polyphony, and other devices rarely used by most of the composers of the period.",3.618

"Here's a question based on the provided text:

What is Theda Skocpol's main argument about what drives social revolutions, according to her 1979 book ""States and Social Revolutions""?",1947039,"States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China is a 1979 book by Theda Skocpol, published by Cambridge University Press, that examines the causes of social revolutions. In the book, Skocpol performs a comparative historical analysis of the French Revolution of 1789 through the early 19th century, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. Skocpol argues that social revolutions occurred in these states because of the simultaneous occurrence of state breakdown and peasant revolution. Skocpol asserts that social revolutions are rapid and basic transformations of a society's state and class structures. She distinguishes this from mere rebellions, which involve a revolt of subordinate classes but may not create structural change, and from political revolutions that may change state structures but not social structures. What is unique about social revolutions, she argues, is that basic changes in social structure and political structure occur in a mutually reinforcing fashion and these changes occur through intense socio-political conflict. A convergence of peasant rebellion on one hand and international pressures causing state breakdown on the other hand cause revolutionary social movements. The book was highly influential in the study of revolutions, and has been credited with ushering in a new paradigm.",2.842

What is the primary goal of using weather compensation controls in a heating system?",62262458,"Weather compensation is a technique for adjusting heating systems to reflect the outside weather, using weather compensation controls. If the outside temperature drops, it will increase the temperature of the heating medium in the heating system. These systems reduce fuel usage, mostly by predicting demand, and modifying heating in advance of the change to the interior temperature. The system can also understand the different responses of various parts of the property to exterior conditions, and compensate for that. Additional savings can result from the system understanding the expected demand, and hence avoiding wasting energy heating rooms with open windows, for example.",6.499
"What is the primary reason for the controversy surrounding the maintenance of Shinnecock Inlet, and how has this controversy affected the local beaches?",4551804,"Shinnecock Inlet is the easternmost of five major inlets connecting bays to the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow 100-mile-long (160 km) Outer Barrier that stretches from New York City to Southampton, New York on the south shore of Long Island. It splits Westhampton Island from the peninsula extending from Southampton Village. The inlet was formed by the 1938 New England hurricane, which killed several people when it permanently broke through the island in Hampton Bays, New York. The name comes from the Shinnecock Indian Nation. Maintenance of the inlet has been controversial. It saves boaters in the Hamptons several miles in access to the Atlantic Ocean. The inlet is almost directly lined up with the Shinnecock Canal between Shinnecock Bay and the Peconic Bay, which allows a shortcut to the ocean for boaters on the North Fork of Long Island. Consequently, management has been geared to keep the inlet dredged and open. However, the inlet has interrupted the flow of sand and consequently there has been major beach erosion on the west side of the inlet including the November 1992 Nor'easter that wiped out much of West Hampton Dunes, New York. The phenomenon is called longshore drift. Efforts to prevent erosion with groines have just pushed the problems further west resulting in serious beach erosion problems on Fire Island. West Hampton Dunes was incorporated in 1993 specifically to have legal standing in the skirmishes with Corps of Engineers regarding the practice. In 2010, the inlet was dredged and the sand deposited on the beach at Road K as part of the West of Shinnecock Inlet Interim Plan to replenish the sand. In 1996, following the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, Shinnecock Inlet, 18 mi (29 km) to the northeast of the debris field, served as the primary water access route for vessels transporting wreckage and human remains to shore for most of the recovery effort.

Kress Collection in the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. It was painted in Italy circa 1590 when Carracci and his brother and cousin were pioneering the creation of naturalistic landscape works in which the countryside was depicted for its own sake, rather than as a stylised backdrop to a religious or mythological subject. It can be compared in this respect with his earlier paintings Fishing and Hunting, now both in the Louvre. The painting would have been created in the studio from sketches made in the field. Characteristically of Carracci's landscapes a dark foreground frames the distant view, the perspective enhanced by trees of diminishing height. The painting was acquired by the English art connoisseur John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick and displayed in his private gallery at Thirlestaine House near Cheltenham, England.

"What is the primary instrument used to play traditional folk music in the region of Auvergne, France?",1400477,"Auvergne is a region in France. Its best-known form of folk music is that played on the cabrette, a bagpipe made of goatskin. This is used to play swift, 3/8 dance music, slow airs (regrets) and other styles. The traditional master Joseph Rouls taught many modern players, including Dominique Paris, Jean Bona and Michel Esbelin. Other styles of music include the shepherd's calls known as ballero. Joseph Canteloube was a well-known composer from Auvergne in the early 20th century, and produced a famous collection of folk music called Songs of the Auvergne. The hurdy-gurdy became the basis for bal-musette music, which arrived in Paris by 1880 as a result of Auvergnat migration. The influence of Antoine Bouscatel led to bal-musette incorporating the Italian accordion, which soon came to dominate the music. This is the period that produced internationally known masters like Léon Chanal, Emile Vacher and Martin Cayla. Vacher's light style, rhythmic nature and distinctive tremolo defined the genre for many audiences in France and beyond. During World War I, elements of American jazz became a part of bal-musette. The style also became the basis for a genre called valse musette. Other Auvergnat musicians include Patrick Desaunay and Jean-Louis Murat.",3.802

"What is the primary theme or focus of the Mēnōg-ī Khrad text, and how does it relate to Zoroastrianism?",14600155,"The Mēnōg-ī Khrad or Spirit of Wisdom is one of the most important secondary texts in Zoroastrianism written in Middle Persian. Also transcribed in Pazend as Minuy-e X(e/a)rad and in New Persian Minu-ye Xeræd, the text is a Zoroastrian Pahlavi book in sixty-three chapters, in which a symbolic character called Dānāg poses questions to the personified Spirit of Wisdom, who is extolled in the preamble and identified in two places with innate wisdom. The book, like most Middle Persian books, is based on oral tradition and has no known author. According to the preamble, Dānāg, searching for truth, traveled to many countries, associated himself with many savants, and learned about various opinions and beliefs. When he discovered the virtue of xrad (1.51), the Spirit of Wisdom appeared to him to answer his questions. The book belongs to the genre of andarz (""advice"") literature, containing mostly practical wisdom on the benefits of drinking wine moderately and the harmful effects of overindulging in it, although advice on religious questions is by no means lacking. For example, there are passages on keeping quiet while eating (2.33-34); on not walking without wearing the sacred girdle (kostī) and undershirt; on not walking with only one shoe on (2.37-38); on not urinating in a standing position (2.39-40); on gāhānbār and hamāg-dēn ceremonies (4.5); on libation (zōhr) and the yasna ceremony; on not burying the dead (6.9); on marriage with next of kin (xwedodah) and trusteeship; on belief in dualism (42); on praying three times a day and repentance before the sun, the moon, and fire (53); on belief in Ohrmazd as the creator and in the destructiveness of Ahreman and belief in *stōš, resurrection, and the Final Body. The first chapter, which is also the longest, deals in detail with the question of what happens to people after death and the separation of soul from body. It is believed by some scholars that this text has been first written in Pazend and latter, using the Pazend text, it was rewritten in Middle Persian, but others believe that this text was originally written in Middle Persian and later written in Pazend, Sanskrit, Gujarati and Persian. The oldest surviving manuscripts there are L19, found in the British Library, written in Pazend and Gujarati, which is believed to date back to 1520. One of the characteristics of L19 text is that the word Xrad ""wisdom"" is spelled as Xard throughout the text. The oldest surviving Pahlavi version of this text is K43 found in Royal Library, Denmark. The Mēnōg-ī Khrad was first translated into English as West, Edward William (1885).

He was made Earl of Kilkenny in the Peerage of Ireland in 1793. The earldom technically became extinct on his death in 1846, when he was succeeded in the viscountcy by his nephew, the thirteenth Viscount. Despite the official title version, members of the Butler family have been known to refer to themselves as the rightful heirs to both the earldom and dukedom of Kilkenny. His son, the fourteenth Viscount, assumed in 1891 by Royal licence the surname of Rawson-Butler and the arms of Rawson when he inherited the Nidd Hall estate but in 1902 he resumed by Royal licence the surname of Butler only. In 1911 he was created Baron Mountgarret, of Nidd in the West Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. As of 2017 the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the eighteenth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 2004. He is understood to be the likely heir to the ancient earldom of Ormond as well as to the 16th century earldom of Ossory, but has not successfully proven the claim. The family seat is Stainley House, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire. The ancestral family home was Nidd Hall, also near Harrogate,",3.624

Previously named simply the ""Ramo Theorem"",
the modified name was introduced by D.S. McGregor et al. in 1998 to recognize the contributions of both Shockley and Ramo to understanding the influence of mobile charges in a radiation detector. The theorem appeared in William Shockley's 1938 paper titled ""Currents to Conductors Induced by a Moving Point Charge"" and in Simon Ramo's 1939 paper titled ""Currents Induced by Electron Motion"".
It is based on the concept that the current induced in the electrode is due to the instantaneous change of electrostatic flux lines that end on the electrode, rather than the amount of charge received by the electrode per second. The Shockley–Ramo theorem states that the instantaneous current i induced on a given electrode due to the motion of a charge is given by: where The theorem has been applied to a wide variety of applications and fields, including semiconductor radiation detection, calculations of charge movement in proteins., or the detection of moving ions in vacuum for mass spectrometry or ion implantation.",6.585

What is the name of the pub in Anstey that was previously known as ""The Chequers"" but is now named after the legendary fiddler ""Blind George""?",3141723,"Anstey is a village and civil parish in the East Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England, about 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Stevenage. According to the 2001 census the population of the parish was 338, reducing to 299 at the 2011 census. The name ""Anstey"" derives from the Old English ān and stīg (footpath). There are at least two books on the history of this village. The first is Anstey, a Hertfordshire Parish, written in 1929 by Rev Frank Ricardo Williams, MA, who was the rector from 1907 to 1928. The second is Anstey: Our True Surname Origin and Shared Medieval Ancestry by GM Anstey and TJ Anstey in which it is shown that all bearers of the surname 'Anstey' worldwide can trace their surname origin to Anstey in Hertfordshire. The Church of England parish church of Saint George is a cruciform building of flint with stone dressings. Its earliest parts are the chancel, transepts and crossing tower, all of which were built in the 12th century. The church was altered in the 13th century and the nave was rebuilt in the 14th century. The south porch and the top stage of the tower are 15th century. The church was restored in 1871–72 under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield. Repairs in 1907 were directed by the architect Arthur Blomfield. St George's is a Grade I listed building. The lychgate is a separate Grade II listed building, as it incorporates a lockup which was apparently used until the beginning of the 20th century. In his book 'England's Thousand best churches', Simon Jenkins refers to a near-miss when a fully-loaded WW2 bomber nearly crashed into the church. This is reference to the crash of a Flying Fortress which crashed on take-off en route to Cologne: all ten crew were killed. Jenkins refers to the church as 'full of Norman mystery'. He pays particular interest to the church font, in which four mermen are carved into the stone. Jenkins refers to the carvings as '...the rarest of pagan emblems'. A folk tale tells of a fiddler from Anstey named Blind George, who disappeared while exploring an underground passage. He is said to have entered the tunnel playing his fiddle, which could be heard above ground. He stopped suddenly, and screams were heard, and he was not seen again. The village has a pub, The Blind Fiddler, which used to be called The Chequers.",3.659
"What was one of Dwight Bolinger's most notable contributions to the field of linguistics, according to Stanford linguist Geoffrey Nunberg, which he described as a hallmark of Bolinger's work?",3089563,"Dwight Le Merton Bolinger was an American linguist and Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. He began his career as the first editor of the ""Among the New Words"" feature for American Speech. As an expert in Spanish, he was elected president of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese in 1960. He was known for the support and encouragement he gave younger scholars and for his hands-on approach to the analysis of human language. His work touched on a wide range of subjects, including semantics, intonation, phonesthesia, and the politics of language. His 1971 book The Phrasal Verb in English, heretofore a subject of concern primarily to teachers of English as a foreign language, brought the need for a scientific treatment of phrasal verbs to the attention of many linguists. His 1977 work Meaning and Form was instrumental in establishing the principle that a difference in form implies a difference in perceived meaning. He was elected president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1972 and awarded the Orwell Award by the National Council of Teachers of English in 1981 for Language—The Loaded Weapon, a book that inspired other linguists to restore a role for the application of common sense in the study of language. Stanford linguist Geoffrey Nunberg has described Bolinger as ""one of the most distinguished semanticists"" of the mid-twentieth century, pointing to his ""uncanny ear for the nuances of words.""",1.129

What is unique about the ovary of plants belonging to the family Polemoniaceae?,2526719,"The Polemoniaceae are a family of flowering plants consisting of about 27 genera with 270–400 species of annuals and perennials native to the Northern Hemisphere and South America, with the center of diversity in western North America. Only one genus (Polemonium) is found in Europe, and two in Asia, where they are confined to cool temperate to arctic regions; both genera also occur more widely in North America, suggesting relatively recent colonization of the Old World from North America. The family can be distinguished from most other eudicot families by the ovary made up of three fused carpels. The members of the family have five sepals, five petals fused, and five stamens that alternate with the lobes of the corolla. For decades, most sources used a classification of the family published by Grant in 1959, but new evidence, including molecular phylogeny, veins of the corolla, pollen, and the flavonoids present, have led to reclassifications, such as the 1998 classification by Grant. It recognizes two subfamilies. The subfamily Cobaeoideae is tropical/subtropical and composed of six genera organized into five tribes. The subfamily Polemonioideae consists of 13 temperate genera. Grant divides it into three tribes, but with the disclaimer that it is not clear what the correct division is and that the genus classifications may be more useful in this subfamily.",3.664

During World War II he was a member of the SS, the military branch of the German Nazi Party, with the rank of SS-Hauptscharführer. From June 1941 until its abolition in October 1941 he was commander of Kamp Schoorl concentration camp. Later on Berg came to Kamp Amersfoort concentration camp and became Schutzhaftlagerführer II under SS-Obersturmführer Walter Heinrich. Due to Heinrich's illness, he was soon appointed as Stellvertretener Schutzhaftlagerführer and in 1943 he succeeded Heinrich as Lagerkommandant. Berg rarely involved himself in atrocities in Kamp Schoorl, but in Amersfoort he frequently mistreated prisoners himself. The no less infamous SS-Unter-Schutzhaftlagerführer Joseph Kotalla acted as his deputy. Berg was involved in the execution of 77 Soviet POWs and about 200 other prisoners. Under his leadership, the living conditions of the prisoners were very bad, both due to the abuse and the food rations that were far too small. Berg fled to Scheveningen on 20 April 1945, but was arrested. In 1949 he was sentenced to death; a pardon was rejected. When he was executed in 1949, he himself was the first to – unexpectedly – shout the command 'fire' against the firing squad in Fort Bijlmer in Weesperkarspel.

"What is the primary challenge facing mobile computing, according to the text, and how did The Open Group address it?",10478649,"Mobile telephony (cellular) has become a commonplace aspect of modern life. Mobile computing is less well established than mobile telephony, partly because of the lack of a common standard infrastructure for secure seamless mobile computing for the Internet. With the increasing number of mobile workers, a secure mobile architecture specification is needed to allow businesses and individuals to maintain secure connections when moving or mobile. Secure Mobile Architecture (SMA) grew from work in The Open Group's (TOG) Mobile Management Forum (MMF). The MMF developed a demonstration of proprietary seamless secure session management across different networks, which was given at The Open Group Conference in Berlin, April 2001. This led to the development by the MMF together with The Open Group Directory Interoperability Forum (DIF) of the Business Scenario – The Executive on the Move. This business scenario described the requirements for directories to support mobile computing. The Open Group then worked on a Challenge to vendors of directories and related products to provide support for mobile computing. The SMA activity became a task group in The Open Group and the participants developed the Secure Mobile Architecture (SMA) over a three-year period, publishing in February 2004. The architecture described in the SMA Vision and Architecture was developed by a team of Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Motorola, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Netmotion Wireless, Wheatstone Consulting and the University of St Thomas.

The death march began in October 1950 when around 180 prisoners of war who had survived the Tiger Death March from Seoul to Pyongyang were loaded onto railcars by the Korean People's Army (KPA) and transported deep into North Korea. The journey is said to have taken four to five days. The climate was very harsh and many of the POWs, who were unprotected and given no food, water, or medical treatment, died during the trip. The cars unloaded on October 30 at the Sunchon tunnel in Sunchon, South Pyongan where the Americans were told by the North Koreans they would be given food and treatment. They were divided into groups of 40 and marched to the ravine, where the KPA mowed the Americans down en masse with submachine guns. A witness said the prisoners ""went around the corner, into this ditch. They [the KPA] said, “Get down; the planes. Get down; the planes. So when we all ducked down some more of them came up on us over a little rice paddy and they just opened up."" 68 people were killed out of 138 people who died during the journey.

What unique characteristic distinguishes the milk shark from similar species in its range?,6855177,"The milk shark is a species of requiem shark, and part of the family Carcharhinidae, whose common name comes from an Indian belief that consumption of its meat promotes lactation. The largest and most widely distributed member of its genus, the milk shark typically measures 1.1 m (3.6 ft) long, and can be found in coastal tropical waters throughout the eastern Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific regions. Occurring from the surface to a depth of 200 m (660 ft), this species is common near beaches and in estuaries, and has been recorded swimming up rivers in Cambodia. Juveniles are known to inhabit tidal pools and seagrass meadows. The milk shark has a slender body with a long, pointed snout and large eyes, and is a nondescript gray above and white below. This shark can be distinguished from similar species in its range by the long furrows at the corners of its mouth, and seven to 15 enlarged pores just above them. Among the most abundant sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common with other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being vulnerable.",3.795

He joined the Franciscan order after separating from his wife in 1310, and became famous as a preacher. He was elected through the influence of the excommunicated Holy Roman Emperor, Louis the Bavarian, by an assembly of priests and laymen, and consecrated at Old St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, on 12 May 1328 by the bishop of Venice. After spending four months in Rome, he withdrew with Louis IV to Viterbo, but in December 1328 the papal legate Cardinal Orsini began a campaign against Viterbo and Corneto. Nicholas moved on to Grosseto and then to Pisa, where he was guarded by the imperial vicar. On 19 February 1329, Nicholas V presided at a ceremony in the Duomo of Pisa, at which a straw puppet representing Pope John XXII and dressed in pontifical robes was formally condemned, degraded, and handed over to the secular arm. Nicholas V was excommunicated by Pope John XXII in April 1329, and sought refuge with Count Boniface of Donoratico near Piombino. Having obtained assurance of pardon, he presented a confession of his sins first to the archbishop of Pisa, and then at Avignon on 25 August 1330, to John XXII, who absolved him. He remained in honourable imprisonment in the papal palace, Avignon until his death in October 1333. Despite this reconciliation, memories of him were highly negative in the later 1330s. In a monumental fresco by Buonamico Buffalmacco in the Camposanto Monumentale di Pisa, Nicholas V is depicted in Hell being dismembered and eaten by demons. The inscription describes him as a ""friend of Muhammad"", who is shown being tortured at his feet.",3.872

What is the typical age range at which people with Satoyoshi syndrome typically develop symptoms of the illness?,6537257,"Satoyoshi syndrome, also known as Komuragaeri syndrome, is a rare progressive disorder of presumed autoimmune cause, characterized by painful muscle spasms, alopecia, diarrhea, endocrinopathy with amenorrhoea, and secondary skeletal abnormalities. The syndrome was first reported in 1967 by Eijiro Satoyoshi and Kaneo Yamada in Tokyo, Japan. To this date, fewer than 50 cases worldwide have been reported for the syndrome. People with the syndrome typically develop symptoms of the illness at a young age, usually between 6 and 15 years old. The initial symptoms are muscle spasms in the legs and alopecia. The spasms are painful and progressive, and their frequency varies from a few to 100 per day, each lasting a few minutes. It can be sufficiently severe to produce abnormal posturing of the affected limbs, particularly the thumbs. With progression, the illness involves the pectoral girdle and trunk muscles and finally the masseters and temporal muscles. The spasms usually spare the facial muscles. Severe spasms can interfere with respiration and speech. During an attack-free period, stimulus-insensitive myoclonus can occur in the arms, legs, and neck. Diarrhea occurs in the first 2–3 years with intolerance to carbohydrate and high-glucose diets. Endocrinopathy manifests as amenorrhea and hypoplasia of the uterus. Affected children fail to attain height after 10–12 years of age. The syndrome is not known to be a primary cause of mortality, but some patients have died as a result of secondary complications, such as respiratory failure and malnourishment. In one 6-year-old patient, antibodies to GABA-producing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase were detected.",1.735

Many of the more northerly species are migratory, breeding in temperate climates and wintering in the tropics; others are attitudinal migrants, moving down from the mountains in the winter. A few species are migratory over part of their range and resident in others. The Seicercus warblers are small passerines that range in size from 9.5 to 12 cm in length and weigh around 4-9 g. All species have green wings and yellow bellies, most have yellow breasts as well. The head is either grey, green or buff/brown, and all species have stripes on the crown or face as well as a yellow or white eye-ring. The sexes are similar to each other. Seicercus warblers feed on insects, usually obtained by gleaning and short sally flights. A few species associate with mixed-species feeding flocks. Different species feed in different parts of the forest, some, like the chestnut-crowned warbler feed in the canopy whereas the Sunda warbler prefers the understory and lower canopy.

What was the primary reason why Jewish attitudes may have discouraged the creation and promotion of heroic figures in Jewish epic poetry?,543459,"Biblical poetry such as the Song of the Sea and the Song of Deborah may be considered early examples of Jewish epic poetry, though very short by normal epic standards. Both songs are compared by scholars to Canaanite and Assyrian epic poetry. There are a few medieval and later works, some translations or adaptations of works in other languages, and other adaptations of Biblical material. It is fair to say that few of these achieved very wide or lasting fame, even within the Jewish community. The most lasting were composed in Yiddish. It has been argued that Jewish attitudes discouraged the promotion of hero figures, generally a feature of the epic form.

"What is the primary function of sebaceous filaments in human skin, according to their natural role?",40131842,"A sebaceous filament is a tiny collection of sebum and dead skin cells around a hair follicle, which usually takes the form of a small, yellow to off-white hair-like strand when expressed from the skin.

They are typical among those with naturally oily skin and large pores, even if those individuals have ceased to produce acne. They are not a sign of infection or any other ailment including acne, and are commonly mistaken for, though cannot form, blackheads. Expression, or squeezing, is discouraged as sebaceous filaments are a natural part of healthy human skin. As such, squeezing can lead to unintentional unnecessary harm, such as scarring or inflammation. They help to channel the flow of sebum within a given pore, allowing it to seep gradually to the surface. In 1979, David A. Whiting described them in a review in the Western Journal of Medicine as ""a loose, porous mass of horny detritus"".",4.216

"What was the primary factor that led to an ""explosion in population and construction"" in Marine Villa neighborhood around 1890?",17070788,"Marine Villa is a neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. The neighborhood is located just south of the large and historic Anheuser-Busch Brewery complex along the bluffs of the Mississippi River. It is further defined by Cherokee Street's Antique Row on the north, Gasconade Street on the south, South Broadway and Jefferson Avenue on the west, and the Mississippi River on the east. The Marine Villa neighborhood lies along the Mississippi River, just a few miles south of downtown St. Louis. Originally part of the St. Louis Commons, this area was subdivided and gridded in 1855, with many of the early developments in the neighborhood being small farms and brickyards. Some of the oldest buildings in the neighborhood are small frame and brick farmhouses built in the 1860s, many in the form of a flounder house, a simple but unique vernacular home, often of one-and-a-half stories with a shed roof. With the construction of a north/south roadway called Carondelet Avenue, Marine Villa was able to continue developing as the city's population grew and expanded from the downtown core. The Lemp Brewery relocated from downtown to the northern edge of the Marine Villa neighborhood in the 1860s, and the neighborhood saw an influx of German immigrants who came to the neighborhood to work at several of the nearby breweries, including Lemp, Anheuser-Busch, and the Cherokee Brewery. In 1890 the streetcar came through the neighborhood, creating an explosion in population and construction. Most of those buildings are still standing, and give the neighborhood its dense, diverse and historic architectural character. Along with the streetcar route, bustling commercial districts developed along Cherokee Street, South Broadway and Jefferson Avenue. Constructed entirely of brick, most of these commercial buildings are of two or three story construction, with first floor storefronts and residences above. Many are used today as they were originally intended, with small businesses occupying the first floor. These commercial districts are now home to the Chippewa-Broadway Business Association and the Cherokee Antique Row District. Surrounding the shopping districts the neighborhood is characterized by single and multi-family historic brick homes, built primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These homes exhibit a range of architectural styles, including Second Empire, Queen Anne, Italianate, Craftsman, and many localized and vernacular interpretations of the more recognized styles.",1.962

What is the primary purpose of visual brand language in terms of creating an impression and influencing customer behavior?",12532512,"Visual brand language is the intentional use of design elements- such as shape, colour, materials, finish, typography and composition- to subliminally communicate a company's values and personality through imagery and design style. It is intended to create a first impression of the brand for the consumer. It is considered by some to be an essential part of gaining both a substantial customer base and work force. Successful visual brand language creates a memorable experience for the consumers, encouraging repeat businesses. For example, the primary pieces of the Starbucks were black and white icons. These icons are certain collection Starbucks will use throughout its brand. Each year, their promotional campaigns would use the same set of icons, but different ones displayed each time, and in different colour palettes. Another distinguishing iconic design element is the BMW 'split grill' continuously employed to represent the brand. While the grill size and design details evolve over time, the underlying idea is consistent, allowing it to stay familiar to its audience. Colour can be used similarly as consistent imagery, as demonstrated by The Home Depot's application of orange across all of its brand materials.",3.757

What was the major turning point in the 1970 New Brunswick general election that ultimately contributed to the defeat of the Liberal government and the rise of the Conservative party?,2472825,"The 1970 New Brunswick general election was held on October 26, 1970, to elect 58 members to the 47th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, the governing house of the province of New Brunswick, Canada. It saw the Liberals defeated, and a new Conservative government take over in the Canadian Province of New Brunswick. Louis Robichaud, the Liberal premier since 1960, called the election early by surprise. Some analysts believed Robichaud was tiring of the job of Premier, and that he had accomplished everything that he had set out to do, such as the Official Languages Act in 1969. With no willing leadership candidates ready to take over at the time, Robichaud called an election. He had hoped that the Progressive Conservatives, led by new leader Richard Hatfield, would not be ready for a snap election, but Hatfield's platform was released two days before Robichaud's. In fact, the Liberals were forced to write their platform so rapidly that they could not get it in by the publishing deadlines for the local newspapers in which they purchased advertising space, forcing them to run blank pages. That gaffe was the major turning point in the campaign. Meanwhile, Hatfield grew increasingly confident. He campaigned across the province in a helicopter, and analysts were surprised at the ease in which he communicated in both official languages. Although the Liberals won the popular vote, the Conservatives won a majority of the seats in the provincial legislature. This was the first New Brunswick provincial election contested province-wide by the New Democratic Party. The party had made its first appearance in New Brunswick provincial politics in the 1967 election but ran candidates only in the district of Northumberland. The party fielded candidates in 15 out of 22 districts in the 1970 election, but failed to win any seats. This and previous NB elections had each county as an electoral district electing a varying number of members, based on their respective populations, with multi-member districts predominating. Each voter was able to cast multiple votes - as many as the seats to fill in the district. ""New Brunswick’s counties originally provided the basis for the province’s electoral districts, an arrangement which would last with only minor changes until 1974. Each district was assigned multiple MLAs (2-5) roughly according to population size and the presence of distinct communities inside each district. However, the boundaries of the new districts and number of seats to be assigned were assigned arbitrarily, and not without a little gerrymandering""",3.822

"What was significant about Thomas Tomkis' writing style that facilitated the popularity of his works, particularly ""Lingua"" and ""Albumazar""?",15054095,"Thomas Tomkis was an English playwright of the late Elizabethan and the Jacobean eras, and arguably one of the more cryptic figures of English Renaissance drama. Thomas Tomkis was the son of a Staffordshire clergyman, John Tomkys, who became the Public Preacher at St Mary's church, Shrewsbury in Shropshire, from 1582 until his death in 1592. John had been appointed Public Preacher by Elizabeth 1st, as St Mary's was a Royal Peculiar, and led a colourful life until his death.Thomas, along with his two brothers, was educated at the Shrewsbury School before matriculating at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1597. Tomkis earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1600, and his Master of Arts degree in 1604; he became a minor fellow of Trinity College in 1602, and a major fellow in 1604. He remained at the college until 1610, when he moved to Wolverhampton and set up a successful legal practice. His college called him back five years later, to prepare an entertainment of King James I. Thomas married Margaret Cresswell and together had three boys and a girl. Thomas died in Wolverhampton in September 1634 and is buried at St Peter's Collegiate church, Wolverhampton. Tomkis is credited with two academic plays of the early seventeenth century: Lingua and Albumazar. He is also regarded as a likely author of Pathomachia. Tomkis represented an important break in the academic drama of the two universities: he wrote in English rather than the traditional Latin. The accessibility of his works facilitated their popularity: Lingua was printed in six editions between 1607 and 1657, while Albumazar went through five editions between 1615 and 1668. More speculatively, Tomkis has been suggested as the possible author of two entertainments, Ruff, Cuff, and Band and Work for Cutlers, and the academic morality play Locus, Corpus, Motus. The nineteenth-century critic F. G. Fleay attempted to link Tomkis with the Tomkins family of prominent musicians in his era, Thomas Tomkins and his son John Tomkins. Fleay's argument is recognized as speculative and incorrect.",1.963

"What is the main advantage of using triazoles in bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the passage?",3046919,"A triazole is a heterocyclic compound featuring a five-membered ring of two carbon atoms and three nitrogen atoms with molecular formula C2H3N3. Triazoles exhibit substantial isomerism, depending on the positioning of the nitrogen atoms within the ring. Many triazoles are versatile, biologically active compounds commonly used as fungicides and plant retardants. However, triazoles are also useful in bioorthogonal chemistry, because the large number of nitrogen atoms causes triazoles to react similar to azides. Lastly, the many free lone pairs in triazoles make them useful as coordination compounds, although not typically as haptic ligands.",6.735

"What is the main purpose of the M'Bona Cult's rainmaking rituals, according to the text?",56006691,"The M'Bona Cult is a system of religious beliefs and rituals which is currently restricted to the most southerly parts of Malawi, but which probably extended more widely, both in other parts of Malawi and adjacent parts of Mozambique. The cult is found mainly among the local Mang'anja people and its former extent reflected that people's wider past distribution. It aims to secure abundant rains at the appropriate season through the making of propitiatory gifts at cult shrines, and includes rainmaking rituals in the event of drought. It has been related to a number of other territorial cults among the Maravi cluster of related African peoples which aim to secure the well-being of the people of a particular area secure from drought, floods or food shortages. The cult is believed to be a long established one, although estimates of how long it has existed are speculative, as the earliest definite record of its existence dates from 1862. There are a number of debates about the sect. The first is what the essential nature of M'Bona is, whether a natural spirit, a deified single human or combination of several such people, a priest or other human intermediary with a god or even the personification of the suffering of the conquered people, whether this identity has changed over time, and whether the name M'Bona has been applied to what were originally different entities in different places. The second is whether the current stories about M'Bona are myths, created to explain the cult after it was formed, oral traditions with possibly a much distorted factual basis or a form of oral history from which actual past events can be recovered. The third is about the exact historical role of the M'Bona cult and whether its ritual practices as recorded in the 20th centuries are a continuation of those of earlier times. Much of the study of M'Bona was undertaken by Father Jan Matthew Schoffeleers, an anthropologist and researcher into African Religion, who was a Catholic missionary in the Lower Shire valley from 1955 to 1963 and then followed a largely academic career in Britain, Malawi and the Netherlands until his retirement in 1998. His extensive study of the cult began in the 1950s and he published eight books or papers on it between 1972 and 1992, besides two academic theses.",2.408

The term was used by philosopher of science Imre Lakatos to blend and revise the normative model of science offered by Karl Popper's The Logic of Scientific Discovery and the descriptive model of science offered by Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Lakatos found falsificationism impractical and often not practiced, and found normal science—where a paradigm of science, mimicking an exemplar, extinguishes differing perspectives—more monopolistic than actual. Lakatos found that many research programs coexisted. Each had a hard core of theories immune to revision, surrounded by a protective belt of malleable theories. A research programme vies against others to be most progressive. Extending the research program's theories into new domains is theoretical progress, and experimentally corroborating such is empirical progress, always refusing falsification of the research program's hard core.

"What was the name of the show that aired in a late-night time slot, showing more events from the house?",28961464,"Secret Story - Casa dos Segredos 1 was the first season of the Portuguese version of the reality show Secret Story, based on the original French version. The series started on October 3, 2010, and the finale, which took place in Campo Pequeno, Lisbon, was on December 31. The show aired on TVI and was produced by Endemol Portugal. The show lasted three months and was hosted by Júlia Pinheiro, Pedro Granger, and Leonor Poeiras. The eviction shows took place on Sundays and a daily diary of what happened in the house was broadcast on the other days of the week. Both were on in prime time. Also, a sister show called Secret Story Extra, airing in a late-night time slot, showed more of the events that took place in the house. On the TVI Direct cable TV channel, the show was broadcast 24/7. Since November 15, another hour of Secret Story began to be broadcast in the late afternoon, therefore making three programmes per day plus a 24/7 channel. In that space, since Week 8, the public could vote for secret missions that housemates would make. On Saturdays, only one show aired a special one with the best moments of the week called ""Secret Story Fim-de-Semana"". A special CD was made with the theme song and housemates' favourite songs. The format is based on the French one, although the Portuguese version has more secret missions. These missions were imposed by ""a Voz"", which served a similar function to ""The Voice"" in the previous series. If a housemate discovered another housemate's secret, he or she would win that housemate's prize money. The money prizes for each mission were different; only the four finalists received their account money. Nominations followed the standard Big Brother format, although, in this series, nominations alternated weekly, boys one week and girls the next. Only two housemates could be up for eviction in each round. If there was a tie in the nominations, a second-round was held in which only the tied housemates could be nominated. As the series progressed, housemates developed friendships, dividing into two groups, Boi Marinho and Toupeira, although at the end of Week 8, when Vítor was expelled, all the housemates became closer.",2.04
"What significance does the character of Mr. Bleaney hold across both Philip Larkin's 1955 poem and his 1946 novel, Jill?",3099774,"""Mr Bleaney"" is a poem by British poet Philip Larkin, written in May 1955. It was first published in The Listener on 8 September 1955 and later included in Larkin's 1964 anthology The Whitsun Weddings. The speaker in the poem is renting a room and compares his situation to that of its previous occupant, a Mr Bleaney. Larkin had previously used the surname Bleaney in his first novel Jill in 1946, where Bleaney is named as a classmate of the hero, John Kemp, at ""Huddlesford Grammar School"", somewhere in Lancashire. But the reader is not told his Christian name or indeed anything else about him. There is nothing to indicate that this is the same Bleaney who eventually occupies the room described in Larkin's poem.",2.051

In 1952 he traveled to the University of Minnesota's Lake Itasca Field Station to take an advanced course on plant pathology, where he was introduced to oak wilt and its vascular transmission through root grafts — this was the genesis of his interest in vascularity and root grafts. Later that year he went on to teach ecology on the faculties of Emory University (1952-1956), Dartmouth College (1956-1966), and the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies (1966-1992).

"What has been the primary impact of the Multifunction Platform (MFP) concept deployed by UNDP in West African countries and Tanzania/Zambia, particularly with regards to women's work?",10189501,"Multifunction Platform (MFP) is a concept and a structure developed by UNDP and deployed in a number of West African countries, and Tanzania and Zambia. The idea has been to place an MFP in a village which, driven by a diesel engine, powers devices such as pumps and grain mills and generators. The UNDP has produced a number of reports on this project in Mali. There are few independent analyses of the development impact of the concept of the multifunctional platform, but an article in the journal Energy Policy provide a more nuanced view of programme achievements than impact assessments made public at earlier stages of the project. The primary impact of the MFP has been on women's work and the UNDP's deployment has been to women's organisations, with part local funding and part local grant. In places where Jatropha is grown, a device, powered by the MFP, can crush the Jatropha seed. The oil produced is suitable for running the diesel engine, allowing the MFP to produce fuel for its own operation. The company Mali Biocarburant has carried out a pilot with in a number of villages in Mali. Also, the Mali Folke Centre has reported on its success in this field. Between 1999 and 2004, 500 MFPs were distributed in Mali. More recently, the FACT Foundation has implemented a pilot programme in which biogas is used for co-fuelling MFP diesel engines. In five villages in Mali, biogas systems were installed and connected to the MFP diesel engines. First results look promising, although further work is required to improve the management of the biogas systems. Volunteers from Engineers Without Borders have been involved with assessment of some MFP projects. Whereas the UNDP's projects have involved substantial injection of foreign expert advice, a low budget self-initiated approach was in recent times taken in Kiliba, DRC at Farm of Hope, a project of Fondation Chirezi. However, that project failed to materialise.",2.059

"What is the primary difference between traditional Australian ""squatters"" who occupied Aboriginal land to graze livestock and modern-day squats in cities like Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney?",60763225,"Squatting in Australia usually refers to a person who is not the owner, taking possession of land or an empty house. In 19th century Australian history, a squatter was a settler who occupied a large tract of Aboriginal land in order to graze livestock. At first this was done illegally, later under licence from the Crown. In more recent times, there have been squats in the major cities such as Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. It would be possible in theory for squatters to be charged with criminal trespass under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act, but squatters are simply evicted when they are discovered. As in England and Wales and also the United States, adverse possession exists in Australian law, although it is rarely used by squatters. This means that if a squatter lives uninterruptedly in a property for over 12 years and against the wishes of the owner, the ownership of the property can be claimed by the squatter.",1.29

"What was the significance of Yamaga's observation of street traffic in Niigata, and how did this influence his approach to writing the screenplay for Royal Space Force?",75036809,"Gainax's proposal to make their debut anime work Royal Space Force was given interim approval in April of 1985 by lead financial backer Bandai after a presentation by planner Toshio Okada and director Hiroyuki Yamaga of a four-minute ""pilot film"" version at Bandai's Tokyo corporate headquarters, following which Yamaga returned to his hometown of Niigata to begin to write the screenplay, taking inspiration from both the city's urban geography and by observing its passing street traffic. A further real-world influence on the screenplay was a trip taken in August of that year by Yamaga and other film crew members to New York City, Washington, D.C., and the Space Coast of Florida to research postmodern architecture and aerospace history as well as witness a launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Noriaki Ikeda, winner of the Seiun Award for nonfiction, argued that Royal Space Force brought to anime the sensibilities that the works of the American New Wave had brought to the live-action movies of Hollywood in the 1960s; remarking on the screenplay's particular attention to dialogue and its nuance, suggesting that unlike other contemporary anime the film did not ""scream its message"". Yamaga asserted that in the service of realistic worldbuilding, he had deliberately attempted to create dialogue that was ""meaningless"" in terms of plot but that instead suggested a dimension of depth existing independently of the narrative. Yamaga and Okada had agreed that the script acknowledged the full range of human nature; the director stated moreover that the film's characters have only occasional ""glimpses of understandings"" towards each other, based on Yamaga's own belief that in real life it is impossible to truly understand others, but that relationships are possible even without such an understanding. Yamaga remarked that his intent to depict a meaningful but non-romantic relationship between the film's male and female leads created a challenge for audiences to comprehend and that the film's highly controversial depiction of an attempted rape and its aftermath had been ""very difficult"" to explain even to the production crew. Following his departure from Gainax, Okada expressed criticism of the screenplay, feeling that at times it made the protagonist's actions confusing for most audiences; while Okada had originally supported the concept of Royal Space Force as an art film whose goal of realism meant that it could not have a strongly constructed ""Hollywood"" script, upon looking back Okada considered that the film's expensive production classified it as a ""major motion picture"" and that with some changes to the script ""it could have met the mainstream.""",4.13

Because the manuscript bears the name Godridus de Malmesburg, it was originally believed that it was written by Godfrey of Malmesburg, a native of Jumièges, who became Abbot of Malmesbury in 1081.

What happens if an Optical Network Unit (ONU) decides not to use its entire allocated time slot in the Bandwidth Guaranteed Polling (BGP) algorithm?,11150457,"Bandwidth Guaranteed Polling (BGP) in computing and telecommunications is a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm for Ethernet passive optical networks designed by Maode Ma et al. at the National University of Singapore. This is an instance of an algorithm that allocates bandwidth based on fixed weights. BGP divides a window of time into fixed-sized slots, a number of which are allocated to each Optical Network Unit (ONU). The number allocated depends upon the ONU customer's service level agreement (SLA). If an ONU does not wish to use its entire allocated time slot, it may inform the OLT about this. The OLT may then decide to reallocate the remaining time slot to another ONU which does not have an SLA. The BGP algorithm may not be entirely compatible with the MPCP standard. This is because the MPCP does not provide any way for the ONU to inform the OLT about the fraction of the time slot that it wishes to use.",2.152

"What was the likely cause of the extinction of Marshallia grandiflora, a flowering plant that was last sighted in 1919?",25172185,"Marshallia grandiflora, the Appalachian Barbara's buttons, is an extinct species of flowering plant in the genus Marshallia within the sunflower family. It was endemic to the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in the Eastern United States, in Henderson and Polk counties. It was found primarily along gravelly and sandy bars along high-gradient rivers, and was presumably wiped out due to changes in this restricted habitat. It was last sighted in 1919. Marshallia grandiflora was an herb up to 90 cm tall. Most of the leaves were clustered around the base of the stem. One plant would produce one or two heads, each head containing pink disc flowers but no ray flowers. It was formerly considered conspecific with M. pulchra, the beautiful Barbara's buttons or Monongahela Barbara's buttons, which is endemic to the central Appalachia region from southwestern Pennsylvania to eastern Tennessee, with the largest population occurs along the Gauley River in West Virginia. A 2020 study found the two populations to represent distinct species, and thus only the North Carolina population was kept in M. grandiflora, with the Central Appalachian populations being reclassified into the new species M. pulchra. Both species are closely related to one another and to M. legrandii. M. pulchra is also threatened by changes to its habitat.",2.182
What was the main reason for Wobbies World's decline and eventual closure in the late 1990s?,6881465,"Wobbies World was an amusement park which operated from about 1980 to the late 1990s in the Melbourne suburb of Nunawading, Australia. The park consisted of many custom-built attractions, most slow moving and aimed at very young children. The park had some characteristic modes of transport including a helicopter ""Whirliebird"" monorail circuit, mower motor driven 6 wheeler ATVs, a real Bell helicopter refurbished as a ground-mounted simulator, a ""Splashdown"" mini log ride, a mini-golf course, trampolines, a ball pit, several food and drink kiosks, a miniature train circuit, a miniature car circuit, four Melbourne W2 class trams and a large Vickers Viscount propeller plane fitted out as a movie-projector simulator. The plane now resides at the Australian National Aviation Museum, in Moorabbin, while the Bell helicopter is dismantled and currently sits in a paddock on Dandenong–Frankston Road at 38°03′57″S 145°12′02″E. One of the Whirliebird helicopters now resides in the front yard of a private residence Despite memorable television advertisements over the decades, the park slowly deteriorated in the mid to late 1990s and had closed down by the end of the decade. Its demise has been linked to the high entrance fee for the time and the charging of separate fees to use some of the attractions. A plant nursery and the Saxon Wood town house estate occupied the Springvale Road site, but the entrance gate, concrete castle, bridges, a train station, the Birthday Room and the miniature golf course from the former amusement park still remained within the nursery. In September 2012, the state government announced that a new Forest Hill police station was to be built on the site. The plant nursery had now closed.

"What is the estimated mass limit of the supermassive black hole at the center of NGC 2681, as inferred from dynamical modeling of velocity dispersions?",53513683,"NGC 2681 is a lenticular galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies 50 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2681 is approximately 55,000 light years across. NGC 2681 has an active galactic nucleus and it is a type 3 Seyfert galaxy. Its nucleus is also a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region. NGC 2681 has possibly three bars, with a relatively large bar at the outer side. Because the galaxy is seen nearly face-on, the bar like structures cannot be projection effects. From Earth based observations, in B-I images the galaxy showed neither grand design spirals nor a ring, but only two symmetrical spiral arms starting from the end of the primary bar. In Hα images some HII regions were observed in the spiral arms. A dust spiral is seen in Hubble space telescope images extending to the centre. The lack of stellar gradient in the central regions and the data from Faint Object Camera, Faint Object Spectrograph and International Ultraviolet Explorer indicate that the galaxy had a starburst event approximately one billion years ago, possibly after the tidal interaction with another galaxy, which involved all the galaxy. Dynamical modeling of the velocity dispersions suggests that NGC 2681 hosts a supermassive black hole whose upper mass limit was set at 6×107 M⊙. As observed from Chandra X-ray Observatory, NGC 2681 displayed three stellar sources within the central kiloparsec of the galaxy. The active galactic nucleus had luminosity 1.8 × 1038 erg/s, which accounts for approximately the 20% of the total luminosity of the central kiloparsec.",4.212

What event led to the decline of the Newfoundland School Society (N.S.S.) and its eventual merger with the Church of England schools in 1923?,18271265,"The Newfoundland School Society (N.S.S) was established on June 30, 1823, by a merchant named Samuel Codner. Codner first came to Newfoundland in 1788 and periodically traveled back to England where he was influenced by the Evangelical Revival occurring there during this time. He was inspired to help Christians in neglected British colonies by the Premier of England, Lord Liverpool in 1821. Knowing the dire conditions in Newfoundland, he formed The Society for Educating the Poor of Newfoundland which had its first annual meeting at the London Coffee House on July 13, 1824. It was the ability of the N.S.S. to deal with the difficult conditions in Newfoundland that led to their great success on the Island. The first N.S.S. school was set up in St. John's in 1823 and within two years, the demand spread rapidly to rural Newfoundland where petitions and applications for schools began pouring out. By 1825, five schoolmasters had been sent between St. John’s, Quidi Vidi, Harbour Grace, Carbonear, and Petty Harbour. Within just ten years, 43 N.S.S. schools had been established on the Island, with an enrolment of approximately 6945 children in daily schools and 4714 in Sunday schools. The N.S.S. began to dissipate in the late 19th century when Newfoundland Legislature established an Education Board and set up Board Schools across the Island, and especially after the Education Act of 1891. In 1923, what still existed as the N.S.S. merged into a denominational school system known as the Church of England schools.",4.322

The activism movement involves doing work in graffiti, break dancing, and hip hop music.

What was the main reason why the government-run steel plant at Kamaishi had to be shut down within 196 days, and how did Tanaka Chōbei respond to this failure?",28736580,"Tanaka Chōbei was a merchant and purveyor to Japan's military during the Meiji Period. He established Kamaishi Mine Tanaka Ironworks in 1887, which was Japan's first modern private ironworks and remained the only one in the country until 1901, when the state-run ironworks was built again. A few years earlier, in 1874, Japan's Ministry of Industries (Kōbushō) had decided to build a modern furnace at Kamaishi. It appointed German engineers who went on to build a large-scale mill utilizing two imported 25-ton furnaces. Local experts had advised a more modest method of learn-by-doing and gradual scale-up. The government, which never questioned the superiority of Western technology, overrode these objections and proceeded to construct the plant and operation started in 1890. However, within 196 days the plant had to be shut down and the government gave up- mainly due to the poor quality of coke made from Japanese coal. Tanaka entered the steel business by taking over this loss-making government-run enterprise. He reverted to the earlier advise of building with smaller furnaces, adapting the technology to local conditions, and then scaling up. Building on local knowledge, he adapted foreign technology through a process of trial and error – it took his people 22 months and 49 trial operations before they could finally produce iron. There was also help from Kageyoshi Noro. By 1894, Tanaka was in a position not only to repair but also redesign British-made furnaces and succeeded in restarting them using coke as fuel. Tanaka Chōbei owned mines all over Japan, as well as the Jinguashi mine in northern Taiwan. His ironworks in Kamaishi produced the majority of Japan's domestic pig iron in 1894.",4.201

"What technological innovation, developed around 1939, enabled the creation of micropup vacuum tubes and allowed for their widespread use in early radar systems?",56398902,"In electronics, a micropup is a style of triode vacuum tube (valve) developed during World War II for use at very high frequencies such as those used in radar. They are characterized by an external anode block, which allows better heat dissipation. These tubes could deliver radio frequency power on the order of kilowatts at wavelengths as short as 25 cm, and on the order of 100 kW at 200 MHz in pulses. Micropup tubes used very high voltages to minimize the transit time of electrons between anode and cathode, providing high frequencies in spite of the tube's large size. The micropup vacuum tube was made possible by the development of vacuum-tight joining of copper to glass, around 1939. The designs used a cylindrical anode and a concentric cylindrical grid electrode; the cathode was directly heated thoriated tungsten wires, which after the first types were all oxide coated to improve electron emission. One type, the NT99 developed by GEC could produce up to 200 kW peak output when used in 600 MHz radar sets. A 50 cm radar set using micropup triodes was used by HMS Suffolk to track movements of the Bismarck. Although widely used in ""metre-band"" radar systems, the cavity magnetron was able to produce significant power at much higher frequencies, as radar systems developed during the war.",4.208

"What is the minimum concentration of a volatile compound required for it to be considered a ""key odorant"" and contribute to the overall aroma of a food product?",28410566,"A key odorant is a volatile compound that is present in concentrations higher than their specific flavor threshold. Key odorants are these compounds that can be effectively smelled. Food products contain a lot of different volatile compounds, odorants. Some of them are present in such small concentrations that they are not perceivable by the human nose. Those odorants do not contribute to the overall aroma of a product. Key odorants on the other hand are essential for the overall aroma of the product. Key odorants can be identified by comparing the concentrations of the odorants with their respective flavor threshold. The resulting unit is the odor activity value (OAV). Every key odorant has an OAV higher than 1. Values lower than 1 are not perceived.",4.232

"What is the primary reason why khapra beetle infestations are difficult to control, according to the passage?",5958109,"The khapra beetle, also called cabinet beetle, which originated in South Asia, is one of the world's most destructive pests of grain products and seeds. It is considered one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world. Infestations are difficult to control because of the insect's ability to survive without food for long periods, its preference for dry conditions and low-moisture food, and its resistance to many insecticides. There is a federal quarantine restricting the importation of rice into the U.S. from countries with known infestations of the beetle. Khapra beetle infestation can spoil otherwise valuable trade goods and threaten significant economic losses if introduced to a new area. Handling or consuming contaminated grain and seed products can lead to health issues such as skin irritation and gastrointestinal distress.",4.243

The symphony is scored for 1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in D, 2 trumpets in D, timpani and strings. The orchestration, which is balanced between strings and winds, lends itself to small chamber orchestras, as well as larger ensembles. The trumpets are scored particularly high, as in many of Schubert's early works. Trumpet players will find, in general, the tessitura sitting between D4 and A5 (as sounded) for most of the first and fourth movements. In the fourth movement, Schubert pushes them up to a high D6, in a repeated fashion. Some careful planning is needed to balance the multiple doublings between horns and trumpets.

What is the primary goal of the nested dissection algorithm in solving sparse symmetric systems of linear equations?,28070753,"In numerical analysis, nested dissection is a divide and conquer heuristic for the solution of sparse symmetric systems of linear equations based on graph partitioning. Nested dissection was introduced by George (1973); the name was suggested by Garrett Birkhoff. Nested dissection consists of the following steps: Form an undirected graph in which the vertices represent rows and columns of the system of linear equations, and an edge represents a nonzero entry in the sparse matrix representing the system.
Recursively partition the graph into subgraphs using separators, small subsets of vertices the removal of which allows the graph to be partitioned into subgraphs with at most a constant fraction of the number of vertices.
Perform Cholesky decomposition (a variant of Gaussian elimination for symmetric matrices), ordering the elimination of the variables by the recursive structure of the partition: each of the two subgraphs formed by removing the separator is eliminated first, and then the separator vertices are eliminated. As a consequence of this algorithm, the fill-in (the set of nonzero matrix entries created in the Cholesky decomposition that are not part of the input matrix structure) is limited to at most the square of the separator size at each level of the recursive partition. In particular, for planar graphs (frequently arising in the solution of sparse linear systems derived from two-dimensional finite element method meshes) the resulting matrix has O(n log n) nonzeros, due to the planar separator theorem guaranteeing separators of size O(√n). For arbitrary graphs there is a nested dissection that guarantees fill-in within a O ( min { d log 4 ⁡ n , m 1 / 4 log 3.5 ⁡ n } ) factor of optimal, where d is the maximum degree and m is the number of non-zeros.

Though SPC's earliest product was for the Apple II personal computer, most of its products were for use on text-based DOS desktop computers, with non-graphical-user-interfaces (GUI), long before the graphical GUIs of Macintosh or Microsoft Windows existed. A salient benefit of Harvard Graphics, then, was that it brought sophisticated on-screen graphics capabilities to computers running the normally non-graphical, text-based DOS operating system. This factor played a role in the company's ultimate demise in 1996, as Microsoft Windows was shipping on most desktop computers. Windows incorporated built-in graphical capabilities, so much of what Harvard Graphics provided was no longer needed. SPC scrambled to develop a Windows version of Harvard Graphics, but big competitors and their Windows-native business and presentation graphics tools had so penetrated the Windows market by then that it was just too little, too late.

What is the approximate height of the Ridge Hill Shelf on average?,21156518,"The Ridge Hill Shelf is a landform that forms part of the foothills of the Darling Scarp, a low escarpment that runs parallel with the west coast in southwest Western Australia. It was formed by coastal erosion of the scarp in the Pleistocene, when the sea level was higher, and the scarp located further west than at present. The action of coastal forces produced sand dunes that subsequently lithified into eolianite, and eroded the ironstone of the scarp, resulting in an iron-rich sandstone with a laterite cap. The iron gives the sandstone a dull purple-brown colour; depending on the extent of iron-enrichment, the sandstone may appear predominantly yellow, predominantly purple-brown, or a mottled combination of the two. The shelf is about 250 feet (76 m) high on average, and is therefore well-drained. It is largely vegetated by a forest of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) and Corymbia calophylla (marri), with an understorey of Banksia, Casuarina fraseriana and Xylomelum occidentale. Some publications identify the Ridge Hill Shelf with the foothills of the scarp, but this is incorrect. The foothills are about 15 kilometres wide, and largely continuous, whereas the Ridge Hill Shelf is no more than 3 kilometres wide and highly discontinuous.",1.352

His 1597 collection Commentariolum in Aenigmaticum quoddam Epitaphium, on the Aelia Laelia Crispis puzzle inscription, included the alchemical Mass of Nicholas Melchior, still of disputed authorship.

Other works are the collection Quadriga aurifera of 1599, and De Occulta philosophia (1601). Barnaud traveled widely around the turn of the seventeenth century.

What is unique about the fat tree network compared to other network topologies like mesh and hypercube networks?,596503,"The fat tree network is a universal network for provably efficient communication. It was invented by Charles E. Leiserson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985. k-ary n-trees, the type of fat-trees commonly used in most high-performance networks, were initially formalized in 1997. In a tree data structure, every branch has the same thickness (bandwidth), regardless of their place in the hierarchy—they are all ""skinny"". In a fat tree, branches nearer the top of the hierarchy are ""fatter"" (thicker) than branches further down the hierarchy. In a telecommunications network, the branches are data links; the varied thickness (bandwidth) of the data links allows for more efficient and technology-specific use. Mesh and hypercube topologies have communication requirements that follow a rigid algorithm, and cannot be tailored to specific packaging technologies.",2.315

"What is William H. Calvin's primary area of research focus, according to his work, and how does he relate it to the development of human intelligence?",193525,"William H. Calvin is an American theoretical neurophysiologist and professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. He is known for popularizing neuroscience and evolutionary biology, including the hybrid of those two fields, neural Darwinism. He relates abrupt climate change to human evolution and more recently has been working on global climate change issues. In his 1996 book How Brains Think: Evolving Intelligence, Then and Now, Calvin writes as an advocate of the idea that brain-based Darwinian processes are what provides brains with what are called ""consciousness"" and ""intelligence"". Calvin starts with the harmless division of brain processes into two types, those that depend on ""cerebral ruts"" (hardware) and those that dance more freely through the brain and so are able to function like ""software""; Calvin usually calls these ""firing patterns"". In his research monograph The Cerebral Code, Calvin suggests that the pattern of action potentials in any particular neocortical minicolumn can be replicated and spread through the cortex like a piece of software code and be ""played"" on the millions of other minicolumns in the same way one can play a million copies of a compact disc (CD) on a million CD players – the key difference being that while all CD players are designed to do basically the same task, the various cortical minicolumns can all have their own unique ""ruts"" and the copies of the firing patterns are not exact duplicates. This allows for a ""cerebral symphony"" rather than just a million-fold amplification of the same tune and a ""survival of the fittest"" process whereby those firing patterns that resonate best with the existing pool of ""ruts"" will dominate one's consciousness and generate intelligent behavior. In writing about what mind will become, in A Brief History of the Mind he notes, ""We will likely shift gears again, juggling more concepts and making decisions even faster, imagining courses of action in greater depth. Ethics are possible only because of a human level of ability to speculate, judge quality, and modify our possible actions accordingly."" William H. Calvin has advanced the view that use of the Acheulean hand axe in hominids was a major factor in the evolution in human intelligence.",6.954

Queen Victoria granted Royal Assent to the British North America Act on March 29, 1867, forming the new nation of Canada on July 1 of 1867. Dominion elections were held in August and September to elect the first Canadian Parliament. Prior to the first sitting of Parliament, the Members of Parliament met to appoint the 72 senators to the Canadian Senate. The 72 seats in the initial Canadian Senate were divided as follows: 24 to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, 12 to New Brunswick, 12 to Nova Scotia. Of the 72 appointed, two declined the appointment, and 2 seats remained vacant. The province of Quebec has 24 Senate divisions which are constitutionally mandated. In all other provinces, a Senate division is strictly an optional designation of the senator's own choosing, and has no real constitutional or legal standing. A senator who does not choose a special senate division is designated a senator for the province at large. On July 15, 1870, Manitoba became the 5th Canadian province and was allotted 2 seats in the Senate. With the increase, the number of seats in the Senate rose to 74.

What is threatening the largest population of San Francisco lessingia, which is found in the dunes at the mouth of Lobos Creek in the San Francisco Presidio?",23779243,"Lessingia germanorum is a rare species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known by the common name San Francisco lessingia. It is endemic to California, where it is known from four populations in the Presidio of San Francisco and one occurrence on San Bruno Mountain south of San Francisco. It is a state and federally listed endangered species. The already rare plant is endangered by many processes, including invasive species, development, sand mining, off-road vehicles and bulldozers, habitat fragmentation, trampling, and pollution, as well as stochastic events. This is an annual herb producing a decumbent to erect, reddish stem no more than 30 centimeters long. The deeply lobed leaves are up to 3 or 4 centimeters long. Some leaves and new stem parts are coated in woolly fibers. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head or cluster of heads at the tip of the stem. The bell-shaped involucre is lined with pointed phyllaries that curl back as the head matures. The head is discoid, with no ray florets but several tubular golden disc florets with raylike lobes. The plant blooms in July through November. The fruit is an achene with a whitish pappus. This plant grows in beach sand dunes and scrub and similar sandy habitat. It is native to the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, a land mass which is intensely developed and urbanized. The single population known on San Bruno Mountain near Daly City was discovered in 1989 and is threatened by the construction of houses in the immediate vicinity. The largest population of the plants is in the dunes at the mouth of Lobos Creek in the San Francisco Presidio. Habitat in the area is infested with non-native species such as ice plant, which produces mats of herbage over the sand dunes, stabilizing the sand; the lessingia requires shifting, windblown sand habitat. Introduced trees have also altered the habitat of the lessingia. Old Monterey cypress and Monterey pine planted many decades ago remain in the Presidio dunes; these native California trees are not native to this particular ecosystem, and have become detrimental.",4.354
"What method has Ning Zeng proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and slow its re-entry through the carbon cycle, which involves burying woody biomass?",74859811,"Ning Zeng is an American climate scientist and academic. He is a professor at the University of Maryland. He is primarily known for his work in the field of carbon sequestration. He is considered a pioneer amongst scientists of biomass burial, and has been researching in the area for over a decade. He has written papers proposing the 'Wood Vault', a process by which woody biomass is buried as a means to slow re-entry of CO2 into the atmosphere through the carbon cycle. He has argued that one of the easiest targets for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is to bury wood that would otherwise be mulched, burned, or simply left to rot. In the United States alone, 'unexploited wood residuals' represent around 300 megatons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. He has also advocated for his carbon sequestration techniques as a possible method to mitigate fire risk in the American West and other parts of the world. Zeng first formally proposed his idea of 'Carbon sequestration via wood burial' in the Carbon Balance and Management journal in 2008. Since then, he has continued research in the area and published a follow-up paper proposing the 'Wood Vault' in a 2022 paper co-authored with Henry Hausmann. this paper highlighted a number of potential approaches; including storing biomass in frozen sites, underwater, or even in above-ground shelters. In 2021, Zeng was listed on Reuter's list of 'hot climate scientists'. He is member of the editorial board at the scientific journal Earth System Dynamics.",4.371

"What factors contributed to the growth and success of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA), including the number of members it gained from 1888 to 1895?",31382545,"Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA) was the first permanent statewide women's rights organization in Kentucky. Founded in November 1888, the KERA voted in 1920 to transmute itself into the Kentucky League of Women Voters to continue its many and diverse progressive efforts on behalf of women's rights. Inspired by Lucy Stone during the national meeting of the American Woman Suffrage Association in Louisville in 1881, a group of suffragists formed the Kentucky Woman Suffrage Association, the first statewide suffrage organization in the South. Laura Clay served as president with affiliate groups in Louisville, Lexington and Richmond. Laura's older sister, Mary Barr Clay hosted Susan B. Anthony in Richmond in 1879 to speak on the need for economic protections for women. She then founded the Madison County Equal Rights Association, the state's first permanent women's rights association. Soon afterward, Mary B. Clay invited Lucy Stone to stay at her mother Mary Jane Warfield Clay's house in Lexington, and Stone mentored the creation of the Fayette County Equal Suffrage Association. In November 1888, Lucy Stone invited Laura Clay to present a paper at the AWSA convention in Cincinnati. Clay agreed and invited all the Kentucky suffragists to join her there to organize a new statewide association. On November 22, 1888, delegates from Fayette and Kenton counties joined the four daughters of the former abolitionist Cassius M. Clay – Anne, Sally, Mary and Laura – to create the Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA). Though Cassius Clay strongly condemned the woman suffrage movement on moral, political and scientific grounds, his daughters led the movement for women's right to vote as well as for legal, educational and industrial rights for women. The KERA adopted the Fayette County Equal Rights Association's broad platform of reform rather than focusing only on women's voting rights. The founding officers were: president, Laura Clay; vice presidents, Ellen Battelle Dietrick and Mary Barr Clay; corresponding secretary, Eugenia B. Farmer; recording secretary, Anna M. Deane; and treasurer. Isabella H. Shepard. They adopted the slogan ""If ye abide in my word....ye shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free."" The leadership with only 66 members quickly organized campaigns with lectures and lobbying, writing petitions, newspaper columns and pamphlets, as well as organizing affiliate chapters around the state. They also encouraged women to enroll in institutions of higher education, hoping to achieve absolute equality in every profession. In 1890 a KERA petition presented to the Kentucky legislature was supported by 10,000 signatures, and by 1895 KERA membership rose to 400 members.",4.427

"What was the significance of the ""Featherbed"" frame in motorcycle racing history, and how did it influence other frame builders and motorcycles?",21023024,"The featherbed frame was a motorcycle frame invented by the McCandless brothers and offered to the British Norton motorcycle company to improve the performance of their racing motorcycles in 1950. It was considered revolutionary at the time, and the best handling frame that a racer could have. Later adopted for Norton production motorcycles, it was also widely used by builders of custom hybrids such as the Triton, becoming legendary and remaining influential to this day.

What was the cost of restoring St. La Salle Hall after it was severely damaged during the liberation of Manila in World War II?,6244694,"St. La Salle Hall is an H-shaped four-story structure built in the Neoclassical style in the Philippines. It was built from 1920 to 1924 to serve as the new campus of De La Salle College due to a lack of space in the previous campus in Paco, Manila, and to accommodate its increasing student population. It served as the grade school and high school building back from when the college was still offering those levels. Originally built as a three-story structure, a fourth level was added in the 1990s for the residence of the De La Salle Brothers.

"What is the primary purpose of an XML schema, and how are its constraints typically expressed?",846623,"An XML schema is a description of a type of XML document, typically expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the order of elements, Boolean predicates that the content must satisfy, data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more specialized rules such as uniqueness and referential integrity constraints. There are languages developed specifically to express XML schemas. The document type definition (DTD) language, which is native to the XML specification, is a schema language that is of relatively limited capability, but that also has other uses in XML aside from the expression of schemas. Two more expressive XML schema languages in widespread use are XML Schema and RELAX NG. The mechanism for associating an XML document with a schema varies according to the schema language. The association may be achieved via markup within the XML document itself, or via some external means. The XML Schema Definition is commonly referred to as XSD.",2.658
What assumption is made by photometric stereo about the relationship between the amount of light reflected by a surface and its orientation relative to the light source and observer?,19132709,"Photometric stereo is a technique in computer vision for estimating the surface normals of objects by observing that object under different lighting conditions (photometry). It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and the observer. By measuring the amount of light reflected into a camera, the space of possible surface orientations is limited. Given enough light sources from different angles, the surface orientation may be constrained to a single orientation or even overconstrained. The technique was originally introduced by Woodham in 1980. The special case where the data is a single image is known as shape from shading, and was analyzed by B. K. P. Horn in 1989. Photometric stereo has since been generalized to many other situations, including extended light sources and non-Lambertian surface finishes. Current research aims to make the method work in the presence of projected shadows, highlights, and non-uniform lighting.",2.661

"What is the primary function of an angiosome in medical procedures, and how does it differ from the traditional ""best vessel"" model?",53598094,"An angiosome is a three-dimensional unit of skin and underlying tissues vascularized by a source artery, termed an arteriosome and drained by a vein termed a venosome. It is a concept that is used by plastic surgeons, and other medical disciplines like CMF, ENT, etc., for the design and harvesting of free flap transplants, and by vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists for the endovascular treatment of critical limb ischemia. It is an alternative model to the traditional ""best vessel"" model. An example is the angiosome of the fibular artery, that primarily vascularizes the skin of the distal two-thirds of the lateral-posterior aspect of the leg. Furthermore, also the underlying fibula bone and parts of the local muscles, like the flexor hallucis longus muscle. Small arteries, called arterial perforators, branch off from the larger arteries below the deep body fascia. These arterial perforators penetrate the deep body fascia in their course towards the skin and further ramify in the subcutaneous tissue. A three-dimensional unit of tissue, only encompassing skin and the subcutaneous tissue – but not the tissue from below the body fascia – primarily supplied by a dominant arterial perforator, is called a perforasome. Although multiple other arterial perforators may also supply this unit of tissue with arterial blood, it is the dominant arterial perforator that is essential for the survival of the perforasome. Arterial perforators can be further defined by their path, in three categories: direct-cutaneous perforator, septo-cutaneous perforator and musculo-cutaneous perforator, depending on what anatomical structure the perforator progresses through, after branching from the deep source artery. Therefore, generally speaking, one “big” angiosome can contain multiple “smaller” perforasomes.",1.809

Polybius describes usage of the machine: They were used again unsuccessfully during the siege of Chios. This may have been the siege conducted by Philip V of Macedon in 201 BC, but neither source specified the date. A different design of machine, also called a sambuca, was used unsuccessfully by Mithridates VI of Pontus in his attack on Rhodes in 88 B.C. The engine was built upon two ships lashed together and consisted of towers between which an assault bridge was hoisted. Mithridates' sambuca had rams and projectiles as part of its offensive battery. During its deployment but before it could be successfully employed to transport soldiers, it fell. With it, fell the fortunes of the eastern wave against Rhodes, the Pontic king withdrawing. Fifteen years later, Mithridates again used a siege engine, in his unsuccessful attack on Cyzicus. Later classical sources confuse the sambuca for a ship-mounted siege tower. Vegetius used the term sambuca as the name given to the assault ramp mounted on a siege tower.

"What is the role of water molecules in the structure and function of gadobenic acid, a gadolinium-based MRI contrast medium?",20362233,"Gadobenic acid (INN, brand name Multihance) is a complex of gadolinium with the ligand BOPTA. In the form of the methylglucamine salt meglumine gadobenate (INNm) or gadobenate dimeglumine (USAN), it is used as a gadolinium-based MRI contrast medium. BOPTA is a derivative of DTPA in which one terminal carboxyl group, –C(O)OH is replaced by -C–O–CH2C6H5. Thus gadobenic acid is closely related to gadopentetic acid. BOPTA itself was first synthesized in 1995. In the ""gadobenate"" ion gadolinium ion is 9-coordinate with BOPTA acting as an 8-coordinating ligand. The ninth position is occupied by a water molecule, which exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the strongly paramagnetic complex, providing a mechanism for MRI contrast enhancement. 139La NMR studies on the diamagnetic La-BOPTA2− complex suggest that the Gd complex maintains in solution the same kind of coordination as found, by X-ray crystallography, in the solid state for Gd-BOPTA disodium salt.",4.523

"What is the primary goal of the Provenance Markup Language (PML), and how has its use evolved over time?",38535032,"The Provenance Markup Language is an interlingua for representing and sharing knowledge about how information published on the Web was asserted from information sources and/or derived from Web information by intelligent agents. The language was initially developed in support of DARPA Agent Markup Language with a goal of explaining how automated theorem provers (ATP) derive conclusions from a set of axioms. Information, inference steps, inference rules, and agents are the three main building blocks of the language. In the context of an inference step, information can play the role of antecedent and conclusion. Information can also play the role of axiom that is basically a conclusion with no antecedents. PML uses the broad philosophical definition of agent as opposed to any other more specific definition of agent. The use of PML in subsequent projects evolved the language in new directions broadening its capability to represent provenance knowledge beyond the realm of ATPs and automated reasoning. The original set of requirements were relaxed to include the following: information originally represented as logical sentences in the Knowledge Interchange Format were allowed to be information written in any language including the English language; and inference rules originally defined as patterns over antecedents and conclusions of inference steps were allowed to be underspecified as long as they were identified and named. These relaxations were essential to explain how knowledge is extracted from text through the use of information extraction components. Enhancements were also required to further understand motivation behind the need of automated theorem provers to derive conclusions: new capabilities were added to annotate how information playing the role of axioms were attributes as assertions from information sources; and the notion of questions and answers were introduced to the language to explain to a third-party agent why an automated theorem prover was used to prove a theorem from a given set of axioms.",1.469

The modern Roman Catholic diocese incorporates the local authority areas of Dumfries and Galloway, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire and parts of North Ayrshire, (Cumbrae). The bishop's cathedra is at St Margaret's Cathedral, Ayr. The diocese was re-established by the Catholic Church on 4 March 1878, with its cathedral in Dumfries and its territory covering the sparse and rural counties of Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Wigtownshire and parts of Ayrshire. Following the reorganisation of the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1947, parishes to the north of Galloway were transferred to it from Glasgow, creating a significant population centre for the first time around the town of Ayr. In response to this development Bishop McGee moved his residence from Dumfries to Ayr, and following a catastrophic fire at St Andrew's Cathedral in May 1962, it was decided that the Good Shepherd Church, Ayr should also become the diocesan cathedral.

"What is the mechanism by which bacteriocin AS-48 interacts with susceptible cells, leading to cell death?",36334864,"Bacteriocin AS-48 is a cyclic peptide antibiotic produced by the eubacteria Enterococcus faecalis that shows a broad antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteriocin AS-48 is encoded by the pheromone-responsive plasmid pMB2, and acts on the plasma membrane in which it opens pores leading to ion leakage and cell death. The globular structure of bacteriocin AS-48 is composed of five alpha helices enclosing a hydrophobic core. The mammalian NK-lysin effector protein of T and natural killer cells has a similar structure, though it lacks sequence homology with bacteriocins AS-48. Bacteriocin uses components of the mannose phosphotransferase system (man-PTS) of susceptible cells as target/receptor. The immunity protein LciA forms a strong complex with the receptor proteins and the bacteriocin, thereby preventing cells from being killed. The complex between LciA and the man-PTS components appears to involve an on–off type mechanism that allows complex formation only in the presence of bacteriocin; otherwise no complexes were observed between LciA and the receptor proteins.",1.883

"Here's a question based on the provided sentence:

What is the primary function of U8 small nucleolar RNA in molecular biology?",11422390,"In molecular biology, U8 small nucleolar RNA is the RNA component of a small RNA:protein complex which is required for biogenesis of mature large subunit ribosomal RNAs, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs. More specifically, U8 is a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule which functions in the modification of other small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). This type of modifying RNA is usually located in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell which is a major site of snRNA biogenesis. It is known as a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and also often referred to as a guide RNA. snoRNA U8 belongs to the C/D box class of snoRNAs which contain the conserved sequence motifs known as the C box (UGAUGA) and the D box (CUGA). Most of the members of the box C/D family function in directing site-specific 2'-O-methylation of substrate RNAs. U8 RNA genes have been identified in human, mouse, rat and the amphibian Xenopus laevis.",1.914

The organizers of the race invited 25 entries, but were only going to pay starting money to 19: sixteen pre-selected cars plus the 3 fastest of the remaining 9. Three of the cars without starting money decided not to race after practising. A fourth entry was a single car for Cliff Allison and Henry Taylor. UDT Laystall decided to let the fastest driver in practice compete, but Allison wrecked the car on his first practice lap. The Emeryson cars were also discarded by Equipe Nationale Belge after discovering terminal chassis damage on one of them, although Willy Mairesse gained the use of a Team Lotus spare machine to post a better time on Saturday. The team eventually reached a deal for Mairesse and Lucien Bianchi to compete in the race with the older, yet proven, Lotus 18s of non-starters Marsh and Seidel. The race was completely dominated by the Ferrari team, with the four works drivers finishing 1-2-3-4. This was the last time any constructor achieved this score in a F1 race. Of the four works Ferraris, three cars were painted red in the tradition of rosso corsa, the national racing colour of Italy, and Gendebien's car was painted in a Belgian racing yellow. Apart from two NART entries in the 1964 season this was the last time a Ferrari car wore other than the traditional red colour in Formula One. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start from sixth on the grid, he could not hold off the Italian cars and all had passed him by the end of the first lap. Hill fought with John Surtees for fifth place until he retired with an oil leak on the 24th lap.",2.818

What is the size of the red zone in Microsoft Windows on an x86 system?,31462850,"In computing, the red zone is a fixed-size area in a function's stack frame below the current stack pointer that is reserved and safe to use. It is most commonly used in leaf functions for allocating additional stack memory, without moving the stack pointer, which saves an instruction. Whether a red zone is present depends on the calling convention. x86-64 systems that use the System V AMD64 ABI use a 128-byte red zone that begins directly under the current value of the stack pointer. The OpenRISC toolchain assumes a 128-byte red zone. Microsoft Windows does not have the concept of a red zone on x86. In fact, the ABI explicitly states that the memory beyond the stack pointer is volatile and may be overwritten by debuggers or interrupt handlers. However, Microsoft Windows has a red zone of 16 bytes on IA-64, 8 bytes on AArch32, and 16 bytes on AArch64. The red zone is safe from modification by interrupt/exception/signal handlers.",4.457

What factor prevented Parma Associazione Calcio from winning more silverware despite their impressive performance in European competitions during this period?",27912034,"Parma Associazione Calcio once again troubled the top teams in both Italy and Europe, but had to settle for just the curtain-raising UEFA Super Cup as silverware in its ambitious ascent towards the top of Italian football. It almost repeated the victory in the 1992–93 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by reaching another final, but lost out to Arsenal. The purchase of Gianfranco Zola from Napoli was successful, given his second place in the topscoring charts, beaten only by Giuseppe Signori of Lazio. Together with Tomas Brolin and Faustino Asprilla, Parma's attack left many teams without a chance, but the defence was not good enough to match the level of champions Milan, who conceded less than half of the 35 goals Parma did.",4.07

"What was the reason for Prokopije/Ivačković's resignation as Patriarch in 1879, according to historians?",50165649,"Prokopije or Procopius was an Austro-Hungarian cleric of the Romanian Orthodox and Serbian Orthodox churches who ultimately served as the latter's Patriarch at Karlovci. He was born in the Banat as a subject of the Austrian Empire, his ethnic affiliations alternating between the Serb and Romanian communities. Ivačković's early life was spent in Serbian Orthodox institutions, and he was seen as a Serb loyalist before he became Bishop of Arad. During the 1860s, he expressed support for Romanian nationalism, primarily as a founder of the National Aradian Association for Romanian Popular Culture. He backed Andrei Șaguna's bid to set up the Romanian-centered Metropolis of Transylvania, becoming its suffragan bishop; during the Serb–Romanian church partition, he extended the Arad Bishopric south into the Banat. In the final part of his career, Ivačković's mission intertwined with the ethnic conflicts of Transleithanian Hungary. In 1873, following Șaguna's death and the row between Romanian conservatives and liberals, and being the more neutral choice, he was elected Transylvanian Metropolitan. A similar conflict among the Serbs propelled him to the office of Patriarch in 1874. Rejected by Romanian nationalists for having left his Transylvanian seat, Ivačković came to be seen as an associate of the Serb liberals. Although already old and ailing, his resignation in 1879 was widely attributed to Hungarian intrigues, involving Kálmán Tisza, Ágoston Trefort, and Ivačković's eventual successor, German Anđelić. Ivačković spent his final years away from the public eye, dying in Bela Crkva.",4.619

The word may be rendered as ""battalion"", but Abels and Bachrach et al. state this is not accurate because the bataille was a completely ad hoc formation. In late medieval warfare, field armies were often drawn up into three main battles, also called guards or wards: the vanguard (avant-garde), the middle guard, and the rearguard (arrière-garde), often abbreviated to simply the van, middle, and rear. These terms imply, correctly, that the van preceded the middle, which in turn preceded the rear into battle, if the battles were arranged sequentially as a column. If arranged abreast, the van was on the right, the middle in the center, and the rear on the left.",2.473

"What was the purpose of the decree that ordered the listing of all objects stored in the Chalkotheke and the erection of a stele inscribed with that list, as recorded on 4th century BC inscriptions?",10107971,"The Chalkotheke was a structure on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece. Its name and function are only known from 4th century BC inscriptions. One decree orders the listing of all objects stored in the Chalkotheke and the erection of a stele inscribed with that list in front of the building. Remains of a structure discovered to the east of the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia and immediately to the southwest of the Parthenon have been suggested to be those of the Chalkotheke. Only scant limestone foundations and rock-cut foundation trenches survive. The building stood in front of the southern Acropolis wall and was circa 43 m long and 14 m wide, fronted on its northern long side by a portico of 4.5 m width. To make room for that portico, the southernmost portion of the rock-cut steps leading up to the west facade of the Parthenon had to be cut away. Thus, the portico is assumed to have been an early fourth century BC addition, while the main part of the structure is thought to be roughly contemporary with the Parthenon, i.e. to date to the mid-fifth century. A major renovation appears to have taken place during Roman times, as indicated by numerous fragments of architectural members that are definitely Roman in date and have dimensions matching those of the Chalkotheke.",7.142
"Here is a question based on the sentence:

What is the likely explanation for the discrepancy in accounts about King Bertachar's family, with some sources claiming he had sons while others only mention his daughter Radegund?",2912443,"Bertachar was a king of Thuringia from about 510 until about 525, co-ruling with his brothers Hermanfrid and Baderic. Bertachar was probably not a Thuringian himself. Frankish sources, such as Venantius Fortunatus, make the three brothers sons of King Bisinus. They are sometimes considered as sons of Bisinus' wife Menia, or else as sons of Basina, who is called a wife of Bisinus by the Frankish historian Gregory of Tours. Many scholars, however, reject Bisinus' marriage to Basina as ahistorical, leaving Menia as his only known wife. Bertachar's rule probably began between 507 and 511. He was murdered by his brother Hermanfrid, who later murdered Baderic to become sole ruler of Thuringia. This assassination may have taken place as early as 525. Bertachar had at least one daughter and, depending on the source, one or several sons. His sons are unnamed. His daughter, Radegund, married the Frankish king Chlothar I and founded Holy Cross Abbey in Poitiers. She is revered as a saint in the Catholic Church. Two hagiographies of her were produced by her friends Baudovinia and Venantius Fortunatus.

"Here is a question based on the sentence:

What are the potential effects of differences in the computation and separation of oral and nasal acoustic energies on the measurement of nasalance, particularly with regards to the underlying physical variable of velopharyngeal opening area?",21271478,"Nasalance is a measure of the degree of velopharyngeal opening in voiced speech formed by computing the ratio of the amplitude of the acoustic energy at the nares, An, to amplitude of the acoustic energy at the mouth, Am. The term nasalance usually refers to this ratio as a percentage, and thus may be more properly expressed as percent nasalance. The term originated in the work of Fletcher and his associates and is now implemented in a number of commercially available devices. There are small differences in the manner in which nasalance is computed in various devices, and differences in the manner in which the oral and nasal acoustic energies are separated physically, as by a hard separator plate held against the upper lip vs. a two-chamber pneumotachograph mask. However, there have been no conclusive studies of the effect of these differences on a relevant underlying physical variable, such as the area of the velopharyngeal opening.",4.701

"What is the primary threat to the survival of the seepage salamander, according to its current conservation status?",12402796,"The seepage salamander is a small, terrestrial species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to the United States. They are found in small areas of Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, intermittent rivers, and freshwater springs. It gets its name from the seepages around which it lives. It is very similar in its appearance and life history to the pygmy salamander. These two species differ greatly from the other Desmognathus species. They are the smallest salamanders in the genus, measuring only 3–5 cm (1–2 in) in length. They are also the only two terrestrial, direct-developing Desmognathus species. However, the two species are not often seen to coexist, differing in distribution by elevation; although there are exceptions. The seepage salamander is currently listed as Near Threatened, with its numbers declining in most of states in which it is found.

"What is the maximum critical magnetic field that niobium-titanium (Nb-Ti) alloys are capable of withstanding, making them suitable for fabricating supermagnets?",3196431,"Niobium–titanium (Nb-Ti) is an alloy of niobium and titanium, used industrially as a type II superconductor wire for superconducting magnets, normally as Nb-Ti fibres in an aluminium or copper matrix. Its critical temperature is about 10 kelvins. The high critical magnetic field and high critical supercurrent density of Nb-Ti was discovered in 1962 at Atomics International by T. G. Berlincourt and R. R. Hake. Nb-Ti alloys are notable for their easy workability and affordability, distinguishing them from other superconducting materials. Nb-Ti alloys have a maximal critical magnetic field of about 15 teslas and, thus, are suitable for fabricating supermagnets capable of generating magnetic fields of up to about 10 teslas. For stronger magnetic fields, higher performance superconductors, such as niobium–tin, are commonly used, but these are more difficult to fabricate and more expensive to produce. The global superconductivity market was valued at around five billion euros in 2014.

"What was the primary factor that led Ardex to develop pedal-powered cyclecars during World War II, specifically in 1942 and 1943?",862802,"Ardex was a small French automobile manufacturer controlled by Marcel Tamine and based in Nanterre. In 1934, Ardex produced its first cyclecar, which followed the form of the Morgan three-wheeler and was powered by a V2 500 cc engine. A four-wheel car followed in 1937 which was at the time the cheapest car on the French market, priced at 5,500 francs: 10,900 francs were needed to buy a Simca 5. In September 1939 France declared war on Germany and in June 1940 the German Army rapidly invaded and occupied Northern France. The war years were characterised by a desperate shortage of raw materials for civilian industry and of petrol. Their experience of producing very small lightweight cyclecars now encouraged Ardex to develop several little cars powered initially by electric batteries and later by pedal power during 1942 and 1943. The first significant order came from the Fulmen Company, then a leading French producer of electrical goods and equipment. The early wartime cyclecars came on four wheels, but the number of the wheels was quickly reduced to three since during 1942 tyres became increasingly hard to find and, where found, hard to afford. In October 1942 the occupying power banned the construction of electric cars, following which Ardex were restricted to pedal powered cyclecars until after the war. In 1953, Ardex introduced a four-seater microcar. The engine was a Société Anonyme BriBan (S.A.B.B) single cylinder two stroke unit of 100 or 125 cc. Production ended in 1955. The Ardex name was then acquired by Max Sardou, a French engineer. He went on to create the Ardex S80, which was entered in the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans as a Group 6 Prototype but failed to qualify. It was powered by the BMW M88 3.5L from the BMW M1 and paired to a Hewland five speed manual transmission.",4.096

What are the two lattice formats that lead(II) oxide can occur in?,2537332,"Massicot is lead (II) oxide mineral with an orthorhombic lattice structure.
Lead(II) oxide can occur in one of two lattice formats, orthorhombic and tetragonal. The red tetragonal form is called litharge. PbO can be changed from massicot to litharge by controlled heating and cooling. At room temperature massicot forms soft yellow to reddish-yellow, earthy, scaley masses which are very dense, with a specific gravity of 9.64. Massicot can be found as a natural mineral, though it is only found in minor quantities. In bygone centuries it was mined. Nowadays massicot arises during industrial processing of lead and lead oxides, especially in the glass industry, which is the biggest user of PbO. The definition of massicot as orthorhombic PbO dates from the 1840s, but the substance massicot and the name massicot has been in use since the late medieval era. There is some evidence that the ancient Romans used the substance. It may occur as an oxidation product of other lead-bearing minerals such as galena, bournonite, boulangerite, either naturally or in industrial processing. When massicot is found in a natural environment, some other minerals that may be found with it may include cerussite, litharge, minium, wulfenite, valentinite and limonite.",2.543

"What significant changes did Fox television network make in its first 20 years of existence, according to the book ""The Fourth Network""?",3017511,"The Fourth Network: How Fox Broke the Rules and Reinvented Television (ISBN 1-566-63572-1) is a non-fiction book about the history of the Fox television network. It was written by Daniel M. Kimmel and published in 2004. The Fourth Network details the history of Fox up until the 1999-2000 broadcast season, with events happening afterward included in an epilogue. Many times throughout the book Kimmel makes a point of how Fox, during its first 20 years of existence, radically changed the standards by which network television stations in America operate, such as putting an emphasis on looking at demographics in show ratings as opposed to overall viewership, and working with cable television suppliers in order to attain a broader audience. While much of the book, which is laden with interviews of former network executives, deals with the network's prime time programming, some material is left to the network's other endeavors, both successful and unsuccessful, such as Fox's stunning acquisition of the rights to NFL games, the start-up of the Fox Kids Saturday morning cartoon block, as well Fox's failed attempts at a morning show and late-night talk shows.",7.236

"What event, recorded by the Chronicle of 813, occurred in May 812 and was likely referring to a total solar eclipse?

Answer: The total solar eclipse that occurred on May 14th.",64333682,"The Chronicle of 813 is an anonymous Syriac chronicle that covers the period from 754 until 813. A single copy of the Chronicle survives across four partially damaged folios of the manuscript Brit. Mus. Add. MS 14642, where it immediately follows another anonymous Syriac chronicle, the Chronicle of 846. This copy is of 10th- or 11th-century date and the handwriting is poor. It is written in cursive Syriac script, and may not originally have been bound together with the other chronicle, which was copied in Esṭrangela script. It is also a palimpsest, being written over an erased Greek catena patrum. These factors make the decipherment of the text extremely difficult in places. The Chronicle as it stands begins with the death of the Syriac Orthodox patriarch Iwannis I in October 754. The last year entry is for 811, but the latest event recorded is the death of the Abbasid caliph al-Amīn in September 813. It also records the length of the complete reign of the Byzantine emperor Michael I from 811 to 813. The last sentence, referring to an event in May 812, is cut off. Probably it referred to the total solar eclipse of May 14. These may not be the original end points of the chronicle. It almost certainly began earlier than 754. Its earlier entries may have been copied in a companion manuscript now lost. It is more likely that it originally ended in 813, but it is not impossible that it once extended much later. The Chronicle of 813 is written from a Miaphysite perspective. It is unrelated to the Chronicle of 846, but is related to the 12th-century world chronicle of Michael the Syrian, although it does not appear to have been a source for it. Rather, for the period covered by the Chronicle (754–813), both works largely rely on the same source. The relationship of the Chronicle of 813 to the lost chronicle of Dionysios of Tel Maḥre, which Michael is known to have used, is unclear because Dionysios completed his work in 842, long after the existing Chronicle of 813 ends. There is one known discrepancy between the Chronicle of 813 and that of Dionysios. The former places the death of the anti-patriarch John of Kallinikos in the Seleucid era 1073, while Eliya of Nisibis quotes Dionysios placing it in the Seleucid year 1074. The Chronicle contains little that is not also in Michael, but on a few occasions more detail is given. It is considerably more detailed than the laconic Chronicle of 846. It has a strong ecclesiastical focus, although it does record famines and earthquakes. It contains a valuable description of the anarchy that engulfed Syria following the death of the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd in 809. It is also contains important information on the growth of the Christian community in largely pagan Ḥarrān (Karrhai). It is the earliest source to mention the miracle of the cut-up lamb in the conversion of Anthony Rawḥ.",7.259
"What method of communication did Christopher Rose and Gregory Wright propose as a more efficient means of contacting an extraterrestrial civilization, and how did this idea gain international attention?",2419741,"Christopher Rose is a professor of engineering, former associate provost at Brown University in Rhode Island and a founding member of WINLAB at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; SB'79, SM'81, Ph.D'85 all in Course VI. On September 2, 2004, an article by Christopher Rose and Gregory Wright, titled Inscribed matter as an energy-efficient means of communication with an extraterrestrial civilization, appeared on the cover of Nature with the headline ""Dear ET..."". The article argued that wireless communication is an inefficient means for potential communication over interstellar distances owing to both the unavoidable reduction of signal strength as distance squared and that information can be densely encoded (inscribed) in matter. The article also suggested that information-bearing physical artifacts might be a more likely first form of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization than radio signals. Following the publication, Rose and Wright's idea was featured by a number of news sources including the BBC World Service, National Public Radio and The New York Times with an article by Dennis Overbye and a subsequent editorial. Rose also offered related commentary on the library carried aboard the SpaceIL Beresheet Lunar Lander.

"What characteristic is shared among most Swiss-type cheeses, such as Emmental and Gruyère, that distinguishes them from other types of cheese?",41752340,"Swiss-type cheeses, also known as Alpine cheeses, are a group of hard or semi-hard cheeses with a distinct character, whose origins lie in the Alps of Europe, although they are now eaten and imitated in most cheesemaking parts of the world. Their distinct character arose from the requirements of cheese made in the summer on high Alpine grasslands, and then transported with the cows down to the valleys in the winter, in the historic culture of Alpine transhumance. Traditionally the cheeses were made in large rounds or ""wheels"" with a hard rind, and were robust enough for both keeping and transporting. The best-known cheeses of the type, all made from cow's milk, include the Swiss Emmental, Gruyère and Appenzeller, as well as the French Beaufort and Comté. Both countries have many other traditional varieties, as do the Alpine regions of Austria (Alpkäse) and Italy, though these have not achieved the same degree of intercontinental fame. Jarlsberg cheese originated in 19th-century Norway and is made using similar methods to Emmental. Maasdam cheese is a Dutch version, devised in the late 20th century. All of these are widely exported. In North America and some other areas outside Europe, Emmental is the best known, and is commonly called simply ""Swiss cheese"". However, in Switzerland itself more Gruyère is consumed, and in continental Europe Gruyère, a name with a considerably longer history, tends to be thought of as the archetypal Swiss cheese, with for example ""Gruyère de Comté"" being another name for Comté. Technically, Swiss-type cheeses are ""cooked"", meaning made using thermophilic lactic fermentation starters, incubating the curd with a period at a high temperature of 45°C or more. Since they are later pressed to expel excess moisture, the group are also described as ""'cooked pressed cheeses'"", fromages à pâte pressée cuite in French. Most varieties have few if any holes or ""eyes"", or holes that are much smaller than the large holes found in some Emmental or its imitations. The general eating characteristics of the cheeses are a firm but still elastic texture, flavour that is not sharp, acidic or salty, but rather nutty and buttery. When melted, which they often are in cooking, they are ""gooey"", and ""slick, stretchy and runny"". A number of traditional types have legally controlled standards, for example the Appellation d'origine protégée in Switzerland, often covering the permitted breeds of cow, pastures, location and method of making, period of maturation, as well as details of their food chemistry. Most global modern production is industrial, with little control of these. This is usually made in rectangular blocks, and by wrapping in plastic no rind is allowed to form. Historical production was all with ""raw"" milk, although the periods of high heat in making largely controlled unwelcome bacteria, but modern production may use thermized or pasteurized milk.",7.276

"Here's a question based on the given sentence:

What is the proposed interpretation by scholars regarding the section in the Assyrian King List that mentions ""kings who are ancestors/whose fathers are known"", and how has this interpretation been challenged?",18748897,"Sulili was according to the Assyrian King List (AKL) the 27th Assyrian monarch, ruling in Assyria's early period. He also appears within the Assyrian King List as the first out of the six kings “(whose names were written on?) bricks whose eponyms are"". Additionally, it is stated within the Assyrian King List that he was the successor of and “son of Aminu"". Aminu had himself been the son of and successor of Ila-kabkabu, and Aminu and Ila-kabkabu were among the ten kings “who are ancestors"". The section within the Assyrian King List “kings who are ancestors/whose fathers are known”, has often been interpreted as a list of Shamshi-Adad I's ancestors. In keeping with this assumption, scholars have inferred that the original form of the Assyrian King List had been written, among other things, as an “attempt to justify that Shamshi-Adad I was a legitimate ruler of the city-state Assur and to obscure his non-Assyrian antecedents by incorporating his ancestors into a native Assyrian genealogy.” However, this interpretation has not been accepted universally; the Cambridge Ancient History rejected this interpretation and instead interpreted the section as the ancestors of Sulili. Sulili is also shown as being the predecessor of Kikkia within the Assyrian King List. A man by the name ""Silulu"" is attested as an early ruler of Assur by contemporary seals. He is perhaps possible to identify with the otherwise unattested Sulili, but the inscription identifies Silulu's father as Dakiki, ""herald of the city of Ashur"", which does not fit with the genealogy of the Assyrian King List.",3.79

"What is the significance of the term ""Māya Love"" in the context of George Harrison's song and lyrics, according to Indian philosophy?",34610156,"""Māya Love"" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1974 album Dark Horse. The song originated as a slide guitar tune, to which Harrison later added lyrics relating to the illusory nature of love – maya being a Sanskrit term for ""illusion"", or ""that which is not"". Harrison's biographers consider the lyrical theme to be reflective of his failed marriage to Pattie Boyd, who left him for his friend Eric Clapton shortly before the words were written. Harrison recorded the song at his home, Friar Park, on the eve of his North American tour with Ravi Shankar, which took place in November and December 1974. The recording features Harrison's slide guitar extensively and contributions from four musicians who formed the nucleus of his tour band: Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. Reviewers note the track as an example of its parent album's more diverse musical genres, namely funk and rhythm and blues, compared with the more traditional rock orientation of Harrison's earlier solo work. Harrison played ""Māya Love"" throughout his 1974 tour, although no live recording has ever been officially released. The song later appeared as the B-side of Harrison's second single off his 1975 album Extra Texture, ""This Guitar"", which was the final release by Apple Records in its original incarnation.",4.214

What is the result of rotating a Morin surface 90° around its axis of symmetry, and then retracing the steps of the homotopy back to the original sphere?",2070457,"The Morin surface is the half-way model of the sphere eversion discovered by Bernard Morin. It features fourfold rotational symmetry. If the original sphere to be everted has its outer surface colored green and its inner surface colored red, then when the sphere is transformed through homotopy into a Morin surface, half of the outwardly visible Morin surface will be green, and half red: Half of a Morin surface corresponds to the exterior (green) of the sphere to which it is homeomorphic, and the other symmetric half to the interior (red). Then, rotating the surface 90° around its axis of symmetry will exchange its colors, i.e. will exchange the inner-outer polarity of the orientable surface, so that retracing the steps of the homotopy at exactly the same position back to the original sphere after having so rotated the Morin surface will yield a sphere whose outer surface is red and whose inner surface is green: a sphere which has been turned inside out.

In 1997, members of an archaeological team performing a survey for a mining company discovered approximately 200 bodies on the beach at Punta Lobos, Peru. The bodies had their hands bound behind their backs, their feet were bound together, they were blindfolded, and their throats had been slashed. Archeologists say the fishermen were knifed through the collarbone—straight into the heart—in a giant human sacrifice ceremony by members of the powerful Chimu people as a sign of gratitude to their revered sea god Ni after they conquered the fishermen's fertile seaside valley in 1350 AD. Their bodies, left unburied by the Chimu and later covered up by wind-driven sand, were, despite the passage of time, found in varying states of decay—some complete with muscle tissue, hair, even fingernails. The remains of the fishermen were discovered close to the modern-day town of Huarmey, Peru, about 275 kilometres north of Lima, Peru.

"What are some ways in which wishful identification can positively influence social attitudes and behaviors, and how does this impact the way mediated messages are conveyed to children and adolescents?",31591330,"According to Feilitzen and Linne (1975), wishful identification is the extension of identification, which refers to people’s desire to become or to act in the same way as a certain media character. The majority of research about wishful identification has focused on its impacts on media users’ intimate relationships with, attachment to, identification with, imitation of, or interaction with media figures. From this perspective, research into effects of wishful identification are helpful to understand how mediated messages can be effectively conveyed, and how mediated behaviors and figures can be shaped to positively influence social attitudes and behaviors. Participants in relevant research primarily consist of children and adolescents, as they do not have significant life and social experience. They have greater needs than adults for role models so that they as children may develop and adjust their own social behaviors. As mentioned by Comstock (1993), “television is a catalogue of modes of behavior; whether they affect what viewers do depends on their being taken as rewarding, acceptable, and applicable” (p. 128).",2.949

Before the collapse of USSR in 1991, Tajikistan was experiencing planned economy which was dominated by Moscow. Right after the dissolution, different from other nations which experienced a relatively stable transition from planned economy to market economy, Tajikistan fell into a serious civil war. As a result, the first mission after Tajikistan became the official member of the World Bank, was to recover its economy from bullets and blood. In 1997. $10 million credit was grant for Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Project. The proposed credit was used to conduct necessary imports and to restore production. Under different time periods, the World Bank and Tajikistan worked together in response to various problems. Later on, the economic crisis of 2008 caused the inflation of food prices in Tajikistan. In response to the crisis, the World Bank issued $6.25 million for the Emergency Food Security and Seed Imports Project in order to help at least 28000 households to release the food price pressure. Coming into the 21st century, Tajikistan received financing from IDA and IBRD of the World Bank with respect to programs of healthcare, education, irrigation and agriculture. Over the past years, Tajikistan has received over 130 projects of which 17 are active and a total of over $1.4 billion from the World Bank.

The musical played in Australia, but it was not performed in the United States until more than half a century after it was written. George Gershwin, at 25 years old, was an established songwriter by 1924 when Grossmith and his producing partners, J. A. E. Malone and Edward Laurillard, hired him to produce the score for Primrose for them in London. The musical is the first in which Gershwin wrote some of the orchestrations himself. The year was one of the busiest for Gershwin, as it also included his Rhapsody in Blue and two other musicals. Gershwin's score, and the book by Bolton are old-fashioned for their time, with more in common with the frothy Edwardian musical comedies than with the later Gershwin musicals. Nevertheless, Desmond Carter's witty lyrics and the show's farcical book have been praised by reviewers, while Gershwin's score has been compared with Gilbert and Sullivan. A piano vocal edition of the score was published in London in 1924, but Gershwin's manuscript was considered lost until it was found in America in 1982.",4.241

The lighthouse was built from reinforced concrete in 1933.

At that time the 25-metre-high (82 ft) lighthouse was 150 metres (490 ft) inland, but due to erosion it is now more than 50 metres (160 ft) offshore. A lack of supporting ground has caused the lighthouse to lean. While in 1988 the waterline was still 11 metres (36 ft) from the lighthouse, by the early 1990s the sea had already reached the lighthouse and it started to incline.

Originally, they recognised that a great deal of grassroots development had to take place as a part of the nation-building process, and that government structures would not be in a position to provide all of the resources to facilitate this process.  Over the years, their focus changed from being a grant giver to supporting under-resourced pre- and primary schools by providing infrastructure for children to grow and learn. Its renovated containers are used as early childhood development centres (pre-schools), primary school libraries, feeding kitchens and toilet blocks. Since its founding, it has donated more than 850 infrastructure units to poverty stricken communities. Many of the pre-schools Breadline Africa aims to support currently have unsafe shack structures where children are cramped and age-group learning cannot take place. A new container or prefabricated classroom lets children have a safe space to grow and learn. Safe and hygienic toilet facilities in pre-schools, restore dignity for both the children and the staff. Kitchen units allow staff to provide nutritious meals to the children in a safe and hygienic environment. Breadline Africa annually send hundreds of children under the age of seven to a day at the seaside. Although so many of these youngsters grow up within a couple of kilometers of the ocean, for many of them, this is the first time that they see waves breaking on the beach and have the opportunity to build sandcastles. This initiative is an opportunity for children to develop a love and joy for the ocean but also to learn about the environment around them and how to preserve it through play.

Initially, it was projected to build a large airport with a long runway capable of receive the Airbus A380, but this project has been recently rejected by the government because of the high cost and the environmental impact such an airport can cause. The project will have a total cost of US$42 million and the environmental impact and other assessment studies are underway.

What is the role of the progress zone in determining the fate of mesodermal cells during limb development?,26838148,"The progress zone is a layer of mesodermal cells immediately beneath the apical ectodermal ridge in the developing limb bud. The fate of the mesodermal cells is thought to be patterned by the length of time spent in the progress zone during limb outgrowth. However, some recent evidence using microinjected embryos suggests that the cells are prespecified early in limb bud development. The progress zone acts as positional information to tell which cells to develop into the limb. If cells spend a very short time in this area as they receive signals from the apical ectodermal ridge, then more proximal limb structures are not able to develop even if distal ones can. ",4.264

What is the primary responsibility of a Security Token Service (STS) within the WS-Trust framework specification?

A) Authenticating clients directly
B) Issuing, validating, renewing, and cancelling security tokens
C) Providing encryption for secure token transmission
D) Developing software development kits (SDKs) for native applications",26181694,"Security token service (STS) is a cross-platform open standard core component of the OASIS group's WS-Trust web services single sign-on infrastructure framework specification.cf. Within that claims-based identity framework, a secure token service is responsible for issuing, validating, renewing and cancelling security tokens. The tokens issued by security token services can then be used to identify the holder of the token to services that adhere to the WS-Trust standard. Security token service provides the same functionality as OpenID, but unlike OpenID is not patent encumbered. Together with the rest of the WS-Trust standard, the security token service specification was initially developed by employees of IBM, Microsoft, Nortel and VeriSign. In a typical usage scenario involving a web service that employs WS-Trust, when a client requests access to an application, the application does not authenticate the client directly. Instead, the application redirects the client to a security token service, which in turn authenticates the client and grants it a security token. The token consists of a set of XML data records that include multiple elements regarding the identity and group membership of the client, as well as information regarding the lifetime of the token and the issuer of the token. The token is protected from manipulation with strong cryptography. The client then presents the token to an application to gain access to the resources provided by the application. This process is illustrated in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) use case, demonstrating how single sign-on can be used to access web services. Software that provides security token services is available from numerous vendors, including the open-source Apache CXF, as well as closed-source solutions from Oracle and Microsoft. While security token services are themselves typically offered as web services used in conjunction with other web services, software development kits (SDKs) for native applications also exist.",2.038

What is the name of the training area located in the northeast Heath region of West Lusatia that was heavily used in the 20th century but has since become an extensive conservation area?",40775470,"The term West Lusatia was coined in the 1950s for the old counties of Hoyerswerda, Kamenz and Bischofswerda – mainly in order to make the Museum of West Lusatia into a centrepoint. Culturally and historically, West Lusatia corresponds to western Upper Lusatia, including part of the Brandenburg county of Oberspreewald-Lausitz, between the rivers Pulsnitz and Black Elster. The north of West Lusatia is characterized by the gently undulating to almost level heather-covered moors of the natural region of Königsbrück-Ruhland Heaths, interspersed with ponds and small rivers that drain the once marshy terrain - to the west and south, especially via the Pulsnitz and its tributaries, the Haselbach and Otterbach, and in the north via the Black Elster. Located in the northeast Heath, the Königsbrück Training Area was heavily used in the 20th century. Since then, it has become an extensive conservation area that can only be entered with a guide among, not least because of the munitions that still exist off the beaten track. In the south, West Lusatia is covered by rolling to hilly terrain with wooded summits. The highest hills, such as the highly visible Keulenberg, are over 400 metres high and have an upland character. Almost the entire West Lusatia is designated as a protected area and nature reserve. The name has been transferred to its adjoining natural region to the southwest, an area that extends as far as the Dresden Basin, and has been named the West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands. However, most of this natural region is in the county of Meissen today and only a small part of it actually lies in the historic land of Upper Lusatia.

"What were some of the key differences in social and economic adaptations among the various Ninnimissinuok communities living in the coastal, riverine, and uplands regions of southern New England?",55592446,"Ninnimissinuok is an indigenous term, to refer to Native Americans of southern New England region. These people include the Pawtucket, Massachusett, Nipmuck, Pokanoket, Niantic, Mohegan and Pequot, as well as the people of western Connecticut and Long Island. This term, a variation of the Narragansett word Ninnimissinûwock, which means roughly 'people', connotes familiarity and shared identity. The use of the term Ninnimissinuok does not imply, however, a homogeneity of social forms or motivations among the various groups so labeled. The region now known as southern New England was home to a complex variety of communities, sometimes grouped into larger polities, which can be divided into at least three basic ecological subregions: the coastal, the riverine and the uplands. Although sharing an underlying cosmology, similar languages, and a long history, the peoples living in each of these regions developed distinctive social and economic adaptations. Although their habitations were relatively mobile, being made of striplings fixed in a circle in the ground with their tops tied by walnut bark, covered with mats of reed, hemp and hides, the one main migration of the entire population of each tribe was a biannual one and took place only from winter residence to summer habitation and back again. Maize and other cultivated vegetables made up a substantial part of the Ninnimissinuok diet. William Wood noted in his 1634 report that ""to speake paradoxically, they be great eaters, and yet little meate-men …"" Stanford nutritionist M.K. Bennett concluded that 60% of their daily caloric intake came from grain products and only 10% from animal or bird flesh. To support their dependence on corn cultivation, the men cleared fields, broke the ground and fertilized the soil with fish and crustaceans, while the women tended to weeding with clam-shell hoes, with assiduity that amazed English settlers. Sachems acquired their positions by selection from a hereditary group. The polity of the sachem was called a sontimooonk or sachemship. The members of this polity were those who pledged to defend not only the sachem himself by the institution of the sachemship itself. Colonial writers noted that sachemships could themselves be subjected to a ruler over many sachems, a great sachem or kaeasonimoog, which the English writers referred to as ""kings"". Sachems held dominion over specific territories marked by geographical identifiers. The authority of the sachem was absolute within his domain. It was traditional, however, that for the sachem to strive to achieve a consensus in all important matters. One factor limiting the despotism of sachems was the option, said to have been frequently exercised, for a subject to leave a particular sachem and live under a more congenial ruler.",4.783

"Here's a question based on the given text:

Is it true that every geometrically convex set is pseudoconvex, or are there examples of sets that are pseudoconvex but not geometrically convex?",3235998,"In mathematics, more precisely in the theory of functions of several complex variables, a pseudoconvex set is a special type of open set in the n-dimensional complex space Cn. Pseudoconvex sets are important, as they allow for classification of domains of holomorphy. Let be a domain, that is, an open connected subset. One says that G is pseudoconvex if there exists a continuous plurisubharmonic function φ on G such that the set is a relatively compact subset of G for all real numbers x . In other words, a domain is pseudoconvex if G has a continuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. Every (geometrically) convex set is pseudoconvex. However, there are pseudoconvex domains which are not geometrically convex. When G has a C 2 boundary, this notion is the same as Levi pseudoconvexity, which is easier to work with. More specifically, with a C 2 boundary, it can be shown that G has a defining function, i.e., that there exists ρ : C n → R  :\mathbb {C} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } which is C 2 so that G = { ρ < 0 } , and ∂ G = { ρ = 0 } . Now, G is pseudoconvex iff for every p ∈ ∂ G and w in the complex tangent space at p, that is, The definition above is analogous to definitions of convexity in Real Analysis. If G does not have a C 2 boundary, the following approximation result can be useful. Proposition 1 If G is pseudoconvex, then there exist bounded, strongly Levi pseudoconvex domains G k ⊂ G with C ∞ (smooth) boundary which are relatively compact in G , such that This is because once we have a φ as in the definition we can actually find a C∞ exhaustion function.",4.538

Because of its contest victory, it is sometimes referred to as Rhodesia's ""national song"", which perhaps contributes to the occasional confusion between it and the Rhodesian national anthem, ""Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia"". The lyrics of ""We Who Follow"" extol the virtues and achievements of the first Rhodesian settlers, particularly the Pioneer Column of 1890, and express the singer's self-identification with those figures and events. Admiration is extended to these colonial figures, as well as the sentiment that ""to them this land we owe"". At the end of the song, the singer declares ""on guard for all they won we stand"", and concludes that he will always defend and cherish Rhodesia, his homeland.",4.79

"What was Robert Boyd's preference when it came to expressing himself in languages, as reported by Livingstone?",7047980,"Robert Boyd of Trochrig (1578–1627) was a Scottish theological writer, teacher and poet. He studied at the University of Edinburgh and after attending lectures by Robert Rollock, prosecuted his studies in France, and became a minister in the French Church. All accounts represent him as a most accomplished scholar. A friend said of him, with perhaps some exaggeration, that he was more eloquent in French than in his native tongue; and Livingstone tells us that he spoke Latin with perfect fluency, but that he had heard him say, if he had his choice, he would rather express himself in Greek than in any other language. The Church of Boyd's adoption, which had given Andrew Melville a chair in one university, and Sharp a chair in another, was not slow to do honour to their brilliant countryman. He was made a professor in the protestant Academy of Saumur; and there for some years he taught theology. He was persuaded, however, in 1614 to come home and accept the Principalship of the Glasgow University. Though he was far from extreme in his Presbyterianism, he was found to be less tractable than the king and his advisers expected, and was obliged to resign his office. But he was long enough in Glasgow to leave the impress of himself on some of the young men destined to distinction in the Church in after years. He was Principal of the University of Glasgow from 1615 to 1621 and the University of Edinburgh from 1622 to 1623. He was expelled from these positions due to his opposition to the 1618 Five Articles of Perth and died in Edinburgh on 15 January 1627.",4.349

The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.",4.941
"What is the primary cause of death among snowmobilers, according to the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center, accounting for more than 63% of avalanche fatalities involving snowmobilers in North America?",3826037,"Highmarking or High-Marking is a popular activity performed by snowmobilers in mountainous terrain, where the snowmobile operator tries to ride as far up a steep mountain slope as possible, then turn around and come back down the hill without getting stuck, rolling the snowmobile or losing power. This activity is extremely dangerous because optimum highmark terrain is typically in areas where avalanche danger is extremely high. Snowmobilers are the recreation group most likely to be killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking. According to the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center, ""Avalanche victims are almost exclusively backcountry recreationists--snowmobilers, climbers, snowboarders, snowshoers, skiers and hikers. Snowmobilers lead the list with twice the number of fatalities as any other activity."" Highmarking is the recreational maneuver of attempting to reach the highest point of a snow-covered feature such as a mountain, on a snowmobile. It refers to a specific activity in which the snowmobile operator's main goal is to accelerate and gain maximum elevation upon the face of a mountain before the machine reaches the top of the feature or upward progress is suddenly forced to diminish because of the grade of the feature, which gives the rider no choice but to turn around. A High mark begins when a snowmobiler leaves an established trail and fully accelerates; blazing his/her own trail upward toward the summit of a snow-covered mountain face, ideally lying at a 30-45% grade. As the terrain gets steeper, the machine's acceleration slows down. At the apex of the elevation gained, the rider must sharply turn 180 degrees and descend the feature. The height of the arching track left in the snow by a pioneering rider usually sparks competition within members of a rider's party, urging the rest to surpass the height of the original arch, thus initiating a competition. High marks vary in their degrees of difficulty depending on the pitch of a given ascent and conditions of the snow. Highmarking involves serious personal injury risk factors, most notably the danger of the rider triggering an avalanche and becoming buried in the ensuing cataclysm. According to, ""Highmarking accounts for more than 63 percent of the avalanche fatalities involving snowmobilers in North America."" Highmarking should only be attempted by snowmobilers who are equipped with avalanche transceivers and accompanied by other riders capable of detecting a distress signal and rescuing a buried snowmobiler.",2.589
"What was the significance of Worcester Park House as a residence, particularly during the English Commonwealth period?",5314095,"Worcester Park House, built in 1607, whose ruins are in Surrey, in the United Kingdom, was one of the residences of the 4th Earl of Worcester, who was appointed Keeper of the Great Park of nearby Nonsuch Palace in 1606. During the English Commonwealth the park and house were bought by Colonel Thomas Pride, of Pride's Purge fame. Pride died in the house in 1658. In 1663 a long lease of the house and park was granted to Sir Robert Long, 1st Baronet, by Charles II and a life was added to this lease in 1670. The area known as Worcester Park was once part of a Great Park surrounding the Nonsuch Palace of Henry VIII, and was used extensively for hunting. Samuel Pepys visited Sir Robert Long at Worcester Park House, in November 1665, while the Exchequer was using Nonsuch during the plague. It has been claimed that the first version of the painting The Light of the World (1851–3) by the English Pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) was painted at night in a makeshift hut at the house, the other claimant being the garden of the Oxford University Press Worcester Park House burned down in a great fire in 1948. The remaining walls and chimneys were gradually demolished by the youth of the area during the following ten years. Fruit from the abandoned trees of the old orchards was especially welcome in the postwar years. The lake also silted up during this period following improvements to the Hogsmill River.

What threat led the airfield at Ratmalana to be requisitioned and opened as RAF Ratmalana in March 1942?",28702692,"No. 222 Group was a group of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Formed on 1 September 1941, based at Ceylon. Squadrons were stationed around the Indian Ocean. The group undertook long-range bombing and mine-laying operations that took them as far afield as Sumatra and Singapore. When it became clear that Japanese forces posed an imminent threat to Ceylon, the airfield at Ratmalana was requisitioned to form part of the air defences for Colombo. It opened as RAF Ratmalana on March 1, 1942, when No. 258 Squadron RAF was reformed. They were followed by the arrival of No. 30 Squadron RAF. RAF Station Ratmalana closed in October 1945. No. 99 Squadron RAF (Liberators) was based at Dhubulia in West Bengal from August 1944 - August 1945. It then moved to the Cocos Islands. The group was disbanded on 15 October 1945 becoming Air Headquarters Ceylon. It had inherited six Liberator squadrons; four Sunderland squadrons; and No. 136 Squadron RAF with Spitfires. In turn, AHQ Ceylon was disbanded on 1 November 1957 as RAF installations in Ceylon were handed over to the Royal Ceylon Air Force. AHQ Ceylon was a sub-formation of Far East Air Force.

"What was the fate of Serapia, the Roman saint and martyr, when she refused to do homage to the gods of Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian?",17707235,"Serapia was a Roman saint, a slave and martyr, also called Seraphia or Seraphima of Syria. Serapia was born at Antioch in the late 1st century, of Christian parents. Fleeing the persecution of Emperor Hadrian, she went to Italy and settled there. Having taken a vow of chastity, she disposed of her property, distributed the proceeds to the poor, and entered the service of a wealthy Roman widow named Sabina, whom she converted to the faith. Sabina then withdrew with a few devout friends to one of her country seats near Vendina in Umbria, where they employed themselves in acts of devotion and charity. During the reign of Hadrian, Serapia was commanded to do homage to the gods of Rome. She refused and was handed over to two men so they could defile her, but her would-be assailants fell unconscious. The governor attributed her deliverance to sorcery. They then tried to burn her with torches. By command of the judge Virilus, she was beaten with rods and then beheaded by sword. Sabina buried Serapia in her own family tomb. Sabina met a similar fate not long after. The Basilica of Saint Sabina on the Aventine Hill originally bore a dedication to both saints.",4.584

What is the primary difference in the length of spacer DNA sequences between bacteria and eukaryotes?,3700225,"Spacer DNA is a region of non-coding DNA between genes. The terms intergenic spacer (IGS) or non-transcribed spacer (NTS) are used particularly for the spacer DNA between the many tandemly repeated copies of the ribosomal RNA genes. In bacteria, spacer DNA sequences are only a few nucleotides long. In eukaryotes, they can be extensive and include repetitive DNA, comprising the majority of the DNA of the genome. In ribosomal DNA, there are spacers within and between gene clusters, called internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and external transcribed spacers (ETS), respectively. In animals, the mitochondrial DNA genes generally have very short spacers. In fungi, mitochondrial DNA spacers are common and variable in length, and they may also be mobile. Due to the non-coding nature of spacer DNA, its nucleotide sequence changes much more rapidly over time than nucleotide sequences coding for genes that are subject to selective forces. Although spacer DNA might not have a function that depends on its nucleotide sequence, it may have sequence-independent functions. Spacer DNA has practical applications that enable researchers and scientists to examine interactions between CRISPR proteins and bacteriophages.",4.608

The subsequent confusion and controversy regarding the state government resulted in the 2009 Perak constitutional crisis. In his judgment handed down on 11 May 2009, Justice Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim ruled that Nizar was and had always been the rightful Menteri Besar, and ordered Zambry to immediately cease acting as Menteri Besar. The Court of Appeal granted a stay of execution of the High Court's order the following day, further confusing the situation. On 22 May 2009, the appellate court allowed an appeal by Barisan Nasional's Zambry Abd Kadir to reverse the Kuala Lumpur High Court decision that declared Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin as the rightful menteri besar of Perak.

"Here's a question based on the provided text:

What is unique about the species Protocotyle euzetmaillardi compared to other species in its genus Protocotyle?",41308682,"Protocotyle euzetmaillardi is a species of monogenean of the family Hexabothriidae. It is the third described species of the genus Protocotyle, after Protocotyle grisea (Cerfontaine,
1899) Euzet & Maillard, 1974 and Protocotyle taschenbergi Euzet & Maillard, 1974. The body is 4.5-6.1 millimetres in length, elongate, and it includes, like all monogeneans, a posterior attachment organ called haptor. The haptor is symmetrical, armed with six suckers, each provided with one hook-shaped sclerite, and there is a lateral appendix bearing a single pair of terminal suckers and a single pair of hooks. There is a single ovary, located at mid-length of the body, and numerous testes, more posterior. The oötype wall has longitudinal rows of large cells. The eggs are elongate, fusiform, with a single terminal filament. The species is distinguished from other species of the genus Protocotyle by the following combination of characters: posterior lobe of seminal vesicle absent, diverticulum of oviduct present, and small body size. It is ectoparasite on the gills of a deep-sea fish, the bigeyed sixgill shark Hexanchus nakamurai. It has been found off New Caledonia, in the South Pacific Ocean on a single shark in 2008 and never found again since. It is the single species of monogenean known from this shark. Both other species of Protocotyle are parasitic on the gills of the bluntnose sixgill shark Hexanchus griseus; thus, species of Protocotyle seem to be restricted to species of Hexanchus. The name of the species, euzetmaillardi, means that it was named in honour of both Professor Louis Euzet, a famous French parasitologist, and Claude Maillard, a collaborator of Professor Louis Euzet, both authors of a major work about hexabothriids.",4.614

"What was the significance of the flagpole with a flag on the ""island under the flag"" in Pavlovsk, and why did it have special meaning for the owners of the estate?",76102283,"Monument to Elena Pavlovna “On the Island” is a lost monument in Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was a marble prism standing on a pedestal; on one of its sides, there was a filleted recess holding a marble slab and an inscription with gilded copper letters ""September 12, 1803"". Above the prism, there stood a dark-red porphyry vase, on which bronze birds were perched. On the opposite side was a bas-relief by Ivan Martos: the genius of death with a wreath of roses in his right hand and an overturned torch in his left. The lowered hand, the bowed head, and the outline of the wings of the genius were repeated in the rounded outline of the upper part of the recess. The inscription on the bas-relief read ""Иван Петрович Мартос из Ични делал 1806 год"". The master considered this monument one of his best works. The monument was erected by the order of the widowed Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1806 on the ""island under the flag"" – a small island on the Slavyanka River below the Mariental dam, where a flagpole with a flag was erected, which was raised when the owners of Pavlovsk visited the estate. Elena Pavlovna, to whom the monument is dedicated, was the daughter of Paul I, who died at the age of 18 on September 12 (24), 1803, four years after her marriage. After 1917, the bronze birds disappeared from the vase. During Hitler's occupation, the dam system was destroyed, the flow of the Slavyanka changed, the island under the flag was eroded, and in 1948 the monument was dismantled. In 1944, the bas-relief was removed for restoration and placed in the museum collection; it is exhibited in the Orchestral Room together with the monument to Alexandra Pavlovna, the second daughter of Paul, who also died early after marriage abroad.",5.095

"What was the reason why Andrias cheni, also known as the Qimen giant salamander, was previously avoided by local people and not extensively poached until recently?",75373725,"The Qimen giant salamander is a species of giant salamander in the family Cryptobranchidae. It is endemic to Anhui Province, China, where it inhabits streams and caves in the Huangshan Mountains. The species name honors Pihui Chen, a herpetologist at Anhui Normal University. The common name references its type locality in Qimen County. As with all other Chinese species of the genus Andrias, it was formerly lumped into Andrias davidianus, but its heavy genetic divergence from other members of the genus was known as early as 2001. It was also identified as a distinct lineage in a 2018 study by Yan et al., who identified at least 7 highly endangered cryptic lineages, none of which were known to have wild populations and all of which are affected by extensive hybridization in captivity. One such lineage was ""Clade E"", identified from wild specimens caught before 1995 from the Huangshan Mountains. ""Clade E"" was confirmed as representing a distinct, undescribed species in a study the following year, and was finally described as such in 2023. Unlike other Chinese giant salamander species, Andrias cheni was not extensively poached until recently, as it was previously avoided by local people due to its ""ugly"" appearance. However, the illegal trade in the species soared since the mid-1990s, and the wild population is now considered critically endangered. Recent surveys were unsuccessful at finding any wild populations.

"What are the main differences between cloud block-level storage, such as Amazon EBS, and object stores, like Amazon S3, in terms of their level of abstraction and the types of entities they can work with?",49239302,"Block-level storage is a concept in cloud-hosted data persistence where cloud services emulate the behaviour of a traditional block device, such as a physical hard drive. Storage in such services is organised as blocks. This emulates the type of behaviour seen in traditional disks or tape storage through storage virtualization. Blocks are identified by an arbitrary and assigned identifier by which they may be stored and retrieved, but this has no obvious meaning in terms of files or documents. A file system must be applied on top of the block-level storage to map 'files' onto a sequence of blocks. Amazon EBS is an example of a cloud block store. Cloud block-level storage will usually offer facilities such as replication for reliability, or backup services. Block-level storage is in contrast to an object store or 'bucket store', such as Amazon S3, or to a database. These operate at a higher level of abstraction and are able to work with entities such as files, documents, images, videos or database records. Instance stores are another form of cloud-hosted block-level storage. These are provided as part of an 'instance', such as an Amazon EC2 service. As EC2 instances are primarily provided as compute resources, rather than storage resources, their storage is less robust. Their contents will be lost if the cloud instance is stopped. As these stores are part of the instance's virtual server they offer higher performance and bandwidth to the instance. They are best used for temporary storage such as caching or temporary files, with persistent storage held on a different type of server. At one time, block-level storage was provided by storage area networks (SAN) and NAS provided file-level storage. With the shift from on-premises hosting to cloud services, this distinction has shifted. Even block-storage is now seen as distinct servers, rather than the previous array of bare disks.",4.654

"What is a possible origin of the term ""lido"" in English, according to the text?",40770028,"In British English, a lido is a public outdoor swimming pool and surrounding facilities, or part of a beach where people can swim, lie in the sun, or participate in water sports. On a cruise ship or ocean liner, the lido deck features outdoor pools and related facilities. The term probably made its way into English via ""Lansbury's Lido"", a nickname used in the British press for London's Serpentine bathing place. The bathing place was revamped in 1930 as a project of the Labour First Commissioner for Works, George Lansbury, a plaque to whom appears on the Serpentine pavilion to this day. The re-opening garnered significant press attention as a result of Lansbury's introduction of ""mixed"" bathing. Lido, an Italian word for ""beach"", forms part of the place names of several Italian seaside towns known for their beaches, such as Lido di Venezia, the barrier beach enclosing the Venetian Lagoon. Like the Lido di Venezia, the Serpentine ""Lido"" includes an extended area of shoreline. The nickname ""Lansbury's Lido"" was probably also ironic, given the contrast between the glamour of Venice and the relative squalor of interwar London — not to mention the latter's variable weather.",4.72
"Why did Francisco Franco, the dictator of Spain, take issue with Ángel Franco Martínez's refereeing style, leading to a change in how Spanish referees were identified?",76011140,"Ángel Franco Martínez was a Spanish football official. He officiated in the Segunda División from 1966 to 1969 and in La Liga from 1969 to 1986, refereeing a total of 186 matches. He rose quickly from the lower divisions during the 1960s, when most Spanish referees were still known by their first surname, and sometimes also by their first name. The appearance of a young referee, in the newspapers, with the surname Franco gave rise to chronicles and headlines that Francisco Franco, a well-known football fan, was not amused by: Franco is very bad, Franco ruined the match, Everyone blames Franco, were some of the newspapers' headlines. This type of commentary facilitated criticism of the dictator by some people of the time, which provoked the immediate reaction of the dictator, who urged the refereeing bodies and the media to designate referees by both surnames, without exception. Therefore, Spanish referees are now known by their two surnames, paternal and maternal, unlike referees in other countries who are referred to by their first name and surname.",4.731
"What is the significance of the naval vessels and ironclad warship depicted in the background of James Tissot's 1877 painting ""Portsmouth Dockyard"", beyond simply providing a setting for the main subjects?",59090525,"Portsmouth Dockyard is an 1877 oil painting by French artist James Tissot. It is a reworking of his 1876 painting On The Thames, which also depicts a man and two women in a boat. It measures 15.0 by 21.5 inches. The painting depicts three people sitting in a rowing boat among the towering naval vessels in Portsmouth Dockyard, with another rowing boat crewed by naval personnel passing in the background before the bows of two old-fashioned square rigged ships of the line. In the background is a modern ironclad warship. In the centre is a man wearing the uniform of a sergeant in a Highland Regiment, with redcoat, kilt, and feather bonnet. He sits with his legs crossed, and his hands clasped around one bare knee. He is turning away from the unhappy woman to his left - in cream dress and tartan shawl or blanket, and her parasol up - and towards the smiling woman to his right - in white and black striped dress, with shawl over her arm and parasol furled. This 1877 painting is a reworking of Tissot's 1876 painting On The Thames, which depicts a man and two women reclining lazily aboard a boat moving through crowded shipping on the River Thames. On The Thames was shown at the Royal Academy in 1876 but it was poorly received, with critics questioning the sexual morality of the subjects: one critic described it as ""wilfully vulgar"", and another disparagingly as ""more French than English"". Tissot's less ambiguous 1877 reworking of the subject in Portsmouth Dockyard was more favourably received, but the story remains unclear. Perhaps there is some flirtation between the man and the woman to the left; perhaps the second woman a chaperone, or a sister. The painting was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 under the title Portsmouth Dockyard. The same year, Tissot made a drypoint copy of the painting, which was reproduced as an etching in two editions of around 100 prints each, measuring 9.75 by 13.75 inches, under the French title Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance. An etching of the drypoint reproduction was sold at Sotheby's in 2013 for £1,125, described as a work on ""the theme of comic rivalry in the affairs of the heart"", and one was sold at Bonhams in 2018 for $937. The painting was bought by the Lancashire corn merchant Henry Jump, and descended through his family. It was sold at Christie's in 1937 under the title Divided Attention, bought by Leicester Galleries for 58 guineas, and exhibited at Leicester Galleries under the title Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance. The painting was sold to Sir Hugh Walpole, who left it to the Tate Gallery on his death in 1941. The Tate first exhibited it in 1942 under the title How happy could he be with either, later returning to the original title Portsmouth Dockyard. It remains in the collection of the Tate.",4.747

"Here's a question based on the provided text:

What was the name of the railway that originally opened the Shadwell station in October 1840, and what was its subsequent rebranding in 1841?",5341119,"Shadwell was a railway station in the parish of St. George in the East, London, that was opened by the Commercial Railway. It was situated 50 yards to the east of the current Shadwell DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway, with the former station entrance on Sutton Street. The former station was between Cannon Street Road and Stepney, and was 1 mile 5 chains (1.7 km) down-line from Fenchurch Street. Shadwell opened in October 1840, three months after the opening of the rest of the Commercial Railway, which rebranded as the LBR in 1841. It was eventually incorporated into the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) and was rebuilt in 1895 when the railway was widened to four tracks; Shadwell only served the slow lines on the south side. In 1900, the station was renamed Shadwell & St. George's East, possibly to distinguish it from the East London Railway (ELR) station of the same name. Apart from a wartime closure between 1916 and 1919, Shadwell & St. George's East remained open until July 1941, when dwindling passenger numbers forced its then owner, the London and North Eastern Railway, to close both it and Leman Street station. Some remains of the station can still be seen today: the westbound platform has partially survived although it is somewhat dilapidated, and the red brick station entrance on Sutton Street still survives. The Docklands Light Railway Shadwell station has been built partly on the site of the station.",4.511

What was the original purpose of building the Ligne de Sceaux railway line when it opened in 1846?,290888,"The Ligne de Sceaux was a railway line in France running from Paris, which initially linked the Place Denfert-Rochereau (then called the Place d'Enfer, in Paris, to the town of Sceaux. The line originally opened in 1846 as a broad gauge line to demonstrate the Arnoux system and was extended to the south to Sceaux. A branch, now the main line, was built to Orsay and extended to Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse and then to Limours. In the latter configuration, it is also called the Paris-Luxembourg–Limours line by SNCF Réseau. With a capital of 3 million francs, it was one of five companies placed under sequestration by the State during the Crash of 1847, along with the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans on 4 April 1848, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Bordeaux à La Teste on 30 October 1848 and the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Marseille à Avignon on 21 November 1848. Similarly, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Lyon was nationalised in 1848. In 1895, it was extended north into Paris to Luxembourg station. In 1937, it was transferred by the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans to the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris after thorough modernisation. The commissioning of electric railcars suitable for the line, the Z railcars, and the redevelopment of the infrastructure with high platforms and high-performance signalling made it a core section of a future regional metro, enabling it to double its traffic in less than a year. The section from Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse to Limours was abandoned in 1939. After a period of particularly high traffic during the Second World War and the following years, the 40 km long line was integrated into the Réseau Express Régional in 1977. It now constitutes the two southern branches of line B of the RER south of the Gare du Nord: branch B2 to Robinson and branch B4 to Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse.",4.848

The syndrome, also classified by Kets de Vries as the ""CEO blues"", is an insistence by individuals in positions of leadership or authority to remain in power, despite reaching a plateau in their careers. Individuals in this position may experience feelings of having accomplished all that can be accomplished, and a lack of creativity, or lack of lustre in their current position. Effects are most strongly felt by those who reach a position of power earlier on in their lifetime as they will spend a much greater amount of time on the down slope towards retirement, as opposed to individuals who reach the top in their later years. Effects may also be credited to a realization by CEOs who have reached this plateau of the losses they may endure upon their retirement including: the loss of work
the loss of health and vitality
the loss of public exposure and public contact
loss of influence, power, attention, and admiration
loss of financial stability As well as a desire to avoid difficult situations in which they may be required to confront the sacrifices they made on their way to the top -a fulfilling personal life, healthy relationships with spouse, children and friends, and time to develop outside contacts and interests.",4.557

"What is the primary effect on an antenna's radiation pattern when multiple antennas are grouped together, and how does this phenomenon relate to the concept of constructive and destructive interference?",47021271,"An array is simply a group of objects, and the array factor is a measure of how much a specific characteristic changes because of the grouping. This phenomenon is observed when antennas are grouped together. The radiation pattern of the antenna group is considerably different from that of a single antenna. This is due to the constructive and destructive interference properties of radio waves. A well designed antenna array, allows the broadcast power to be directed to where it is needed most. These antenna arrays are typically one dimensional, as seen on collinear dipole arrays, or two dimensional as on military phased arrays. In order to simplify the mathematics, a number of assumptions are typically made: The array factor A F is the complex-valued far-field radiation pattern obtained for an array of N isotropic radiators located at coordinates r → n , as determined by: A F = ∑ n = 1 N a n e j k r ^ ⋅ r → n , where a n are the complex-valued excitation coefficients, and r ^ is the direction unit vector. The array factor is defined in the transmitting mode, with the time convention e j ω t . A corresponding expression can be derived for the receiving mode, where a negative sign appears in the exponential factors, as derived in reference.",2.329

"What role do genome browsers play in genomics research, and what specific features enable users to visualize and explore entire genomes with annotated data?",4457052,"The completion of the human genome sequencing in the early 2000s was a turning point in genomics research. Scientists have conducted series of research into the activities of genes and the genome as a whole. The human genome contains around 3 billion base pairs nucleotide, and the huge quantity of data created necessitates the development of an accessible tool to explore and interpret this information in order to investigate the genetic basis of disease, evolution, and biological processes. The field of genomics has continued to grow, with new sequencing technologies and computational tool making it easier to study the genome. The genome browser is an important tool for studying the genome. In bioinformatics, a genome browser is a graphical interface for displaying information from a biological database for genomic data. It is a software tool that displays genetic data in graphical form. Genome browsers enable users to visualize and browse entire genomes with annotated data, including gene prediction, gene structure, protein, expression, regulation, variation, and comparative analysis. Annotated data is usually from multiple diverse sources. They differ from ordinary biological databases in that they display data in a graphical format, with genome coordinates on one axis with annotations or space-filling graphics to show analyses of the genes, such as the frequency of the genes and their expression profiles. The software allows users to navigate the genome, view numerous features, analyze and investigate the relationships between various genomic elements.",5.235
"What historical event is believed to have contributed to the detachment of geographically separate parts of the Westover manor, resulting in its current fragmented state?",9932955,"
Westover, Hampshire, is the ancient manor, now in Dorset, over which much of modern Bournemouth has developed. This area of land marked a historic boundary between Celtic and Saxon civilisations, which found expression as the county boundary between Hampshire to the east and Dorset to the west. Geographically detached parts of the manor may have resulted from the post-Civil War breakup of estates formerly belonging to the Lords Arundell of Wardour. The name probably derives from that of the Dorset Stour, which flows through the manor. At Christchurch, the Stour is joined by the Avon, and at one time the river upstream (west) of this point was known as the ""West Stour"", while downstream it was known as either the ""East Stour"" or ""Stour & Avon"". The area bordering the West Stour became known as the Liberty of Westover. Westover is a 'liberty' which meant that whoever owned it gained certain extra rights by dint of their possession. The name was used in an Act of Parliament in 1802 when the heathland of Westover was enclosed. Just over 30 years later, the name was used for one of the proposed new roads as holiday villas were built. Westover Road remains one of the principal commercial streets of modern Bournemouth.

"Here's a potential question based on the text:

What was Nathaniel Wood Sr.'s prediction about the arrival of a ""Destroying Angel"" that would bring plagues and earthquakes upon the non-Israelites, and how did this prophecy affect his followers and the local community?",18607171,"Nathaniel Wood Sr. was the leader of a sect called the New Israelites, which was formed in Middletown, Rutland County, Vermont at the end of the 1790s. Wood emigrated from Newent Parish in Norwich, Connecticut, to Bennington, Vermont. From Bennington he moved to Rutland County in 1761. Wood may have been influenced by the Newent Separates of Norwich, who believed in perfectionist immortalism and spiritual wifery, and the preaching of Rev. Joel Benedict, who taught that Hebrew was the angelic tongue. Wood was excommunicated from the local Congregationalist church in 1789. Subsequently, he began to preach to small meetings whose attendees were mostly family and relatives. Wood claimed literal descent from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and to possess the powers of revelation. After coming into contact with a treasure seer by the name of Justus Winchell, the New Israelites commenced looking for buried treasure and embarked on the construction of a temple. The group employed the divining rod for both treasure hunting and other forms of revelation. It was suspected that these efforts masked a counterfeiting operation. Wood predicted the arrival of a ""Destroying Angel"" that would bring down plagues and earthquakes upon the ""gentiles."" For this reason one might arguably call the New Israelites a Millennarian group. The locals were so alarmed that on the night in question the militia was called out. When this apocalypse failed to occur, Wood and his family moved to Ellisburg, Jefferson County, New York. This event was subsequently known as the ""Wood Scrape.""",4.988

In January 2006, he proposed legislation to ban sorcery, telling parliament, ""It's becoming more popular for people in Bahrain to turn to fortune tellers and sorcerers to find out what their future holds or to act as mediums to harm others or make people fall in love with them. There are many homes around the country that are known to be practicing black magic and if you drive past them a large number of cars from around the GCC would be found parked outside."" This created consternation among the Kingdom's magicians and fortune tellers, with soothsayer Dina, responding, ""I can understand the MPs' feelings because there are fraudsters out there, but it's not fair for those who truly have the gift of seeing the future and dealing with the supernatural."" In February 2006, Mattar proposed the introduction of Sharia Law, saying that the removal of thieves' hands would address rising crime, particularly burglaries. Explaining the move, he said, ""Thieves should feel the agony of their victims and this would be a permanent lesson to them."" Continuing his campaign to introduce amputations, in April 2006 he compared Bahrain's jails to ""five star hotels"" and said that a recent prison inspection by the Bahrain Human Rights Society is ""something I really feel awkward about, considering that the criminals did not treat others fairly when they stole from them"". Mattar's proposals for Sharia Law led to a clash with Bahrain's government when he tried to amend Article 342 of the Penal Code so that those who kill someone in an accident would have to pay blood money to the victim's family or lose their own lives. Determining the blood money would be at the discretion of the victim's family. The move was opposed by a majority of Bahrain's MPs.",2.411

"What are the two main protein isoforms generated by the alternative splicing event in the Annexin VII gene, and how do they differ from each other?",14776459,"Annexin A7 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ANXA7 gene. Annexin VII is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent phospholipid binding proteins. The Annexin VII gene contains 14 exons and spans approximately 34 kb of DNA. An alternatively spliced cassette exon results in two mRNA transcripts of 2.0 and 2.4 kb which are predicted to generate two protein isoforms differing in their N-terminal domain. The alternative splicing event is tissue specific and the mRNA containing the cassette exon is prevalent in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. The transcripts also differ in their 3'-non coding regions by the use of two alternative poly(A) signals. The selection of poly(A) signals is independent of the mRNA splicing pattern. ~Annexin VII encodes a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 51 kDa with a unique, highly hydrophobic N-terminal domain of 167 amino acids and a conserved C-terminal region of 299 amino acids. The latter domain is composed of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. Structural analysis of the protein suggests that Annexin VII is a membrane binding protein with diverse properties including voltage-sensitive calcium channel activity, ion selectivity and membrane fusion.",1.827

John Carrington Cox and Stephen Ross proposed that prices actually follow a 'jump process'. Robert C. Merton extended this approach to a hybrid model known as jump diffusion, which states that the prices have large jumps interspersed with small continuous movements.",2.702

Upon release, Peter Jones of Record Mirror considered the song ""less infectious"" than O'Sullivan's first hit ""Nothing Rhymed"", but described it as ""unmistakeably Gilbert, with that mixture of naivety and power."" John Peel for Disc and Music Echo considered O'Sullivan's ""one of the very few true originals we have"" but speculated that he was ""somewhat misunderstood and misinterpreted"" by the label. Peel opined ""this record is a case in point. It's pleasant enough but most of the distinguishing features that make the man seem to have been filtered out. It's a good song too with quaint and arresting lyrics. It could be, of course, that he's very happy with this record but l prefer to think that the rather cloying production was the idea of the producer alone. Gilbert doesn't fit into accepted channels, therein lies his charm, and attempts to squash him into those channels will only destroy him."" Writing in The Guardian in 2011, Bob Stanley considered ""We Will"" to be ""a song of resigned melancholy about how to get through a personal crisis by appreciating things such as kicking a ball, visiting distant relatives, eating corn flakes."" The Times writer Pavel Barter wrote in 2017 that the song ""introduced a form of kitchen-sink observational drama usually lacking in pop music."" O'Sullivan re-recorded ""We Will"" for his 1987 album Frobisher Drive. The song was covered by Rumer on her 2012 album Boys Don’t Cry. O'Sullivan has recounted in interviews being phoned up by Andy Williams in the 1970s, who was planning to cover the song and wanted permission to change the line 'I bagsy being in goal' as he did not understand the expression.",4.792

What is the primary concern for local authorities regarding the invasive aquatic plant species Elodea that was discovered in Sand Lake and nearby lakes?,9866182,"In Anchorage, Alaska, Sand Lake is the area surrounding Sand Lake, a stocked lake in the southwest part of the city. It is south of the Ted Stevens International Airport and Lake Spenard. The lake itself has a surface area of 78 acres (320,000 m2). It is one of the few big-city lakes in the world with common and Pacific loon populations. Its shores are mostly privately owned, but a small park to the northeast allows public access. Kayakers, fishermen, picnickers and birdwatchers frequent the area. The lake is stocked with fish by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game with rainbow trout and salmon. Northern pike, illegally introduced to the lake, are significant predators on rainbow trout and salmon and have a detrimental impact on these populations. In 2006 residents of the lake asked the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) for help in removing northern pike from the lake and initial planning began resulting in the application of the fish poison rotenone in 2009 to restore the fishery. In 2010 surveys confirmed that the lake was free of northern pike and ADF&G restocked the lake with rainbow trout, Arctic char, and Arctic grayling. In July 2011 an invasive aquatic plant, Elodea, was discovered in dense growths in Sand Lake as well as nearby DeLong and Little Campbell Lakes. It has also been found in Chena Slough and Chena Lakes in Fairbanks; a few lakes near Cordova; and Daniels, Stormy, and Beck Lakes on the Kenai Peninsula. It is suspected that it may have entered the lake through the dumping of an aquarium as this species is a popular aquatic plant used by aquarium hobbyists and is commonly used as a teaching specimen in local middle schools. This introduction is of much concern due to Elodea's ability to negatively impact recreational uses, floatplane operations, fish and wildlife habitat, and property values. Another local attraction is Kincaid Park to the west.
Generally, the residential area becomes more affluent near the lake, with a wide range of demographics expanding out. The local High School is Dimond High School although some students attend South Anchorage High School. The neighborhood was hard hit by the 2005 National Scout Jamboree accident, which killed four Anchorage residents.

"Here's a question based on the provided sentence:

What is the main advantage of using a magnetic nozzle over a traditional solid one in plasma propulsion systems?",51685453,"A magnetic nozzle is a convergent-divergent magnetic field that guides, expands and accelerates a plasma jet into vacuum for the purpose of space propulsion. The magnetic field in a magnetic nozzle plays a similar role to the convergent-divergent solid walls in a de Laval nozzle, wherein a hot neutral gas is expanded first subsonically and then supersonically to increase thrust. Like a de Laval nozzle, a magnetic nozzle converts the internal energy of the plasma into directed kinetic energy, but the operation is based on the interaction of the applied magnetic field with the electric charges in the plasma, rather than on pressure forces acting on solid walls. The main advantage of a magnetic nozzle over a solid one is that it can operate contactlessly, i.e. avoiding the material contact with the hot plasma, which would lead to system inefficiencies and reduced lifetime of the nozzle. Additional advantages include the capability of modifying the strength and geometry of the applied magnetic field in-flight, allowing the nozzle to adapt to different propulsive requirements and space missions. Magnetic nozzles are the fundamental acceleration stage of several next-generation plasma thrusters currently under development, such as the helicon plasma thruster, the electron-cyclotron resonance plasma thruster, the VASIMR, and the applied-field magnetoplasmadynamic thruster. Magnetic nozzles also find another field of application in advanced plasma manufacturing processes, and their physics are related to those of several magnetic confinement plasma fusion devices.",2.773

What was the primary occupation of Richard Henry Savage during his early years in San Francisco?,23757960,"Richard Henry Savage was an American military officer and author who wrote more than 40 books of adventure and mystery, based loosely on his own experiences. Savage's life may have been the inspiration for the pulp novel character Doc Savage. In his youth in San Francisco, Savage studied engineering and law, and graduated from the United States Military Academy. After a few years of surveying work with the Army Corps of Engineers, Savage went to Rome as an envoy following which he sailed to Egypt to serve a stint with the Egyptian Army. Returning home, Savage was assigned to assess border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico, and he performed railroad survey work in Texas. In Washington D.C., he courted and married a widowed noblewoman from Germany. Savage returned to San Francisco with his wife to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and taking part in a family business. He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and took part in the social activity of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage stood up for law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties. When the Spanish–American War broke out, Savage volunteered to lead men in battle. Instead, he was given command of an engineering unit which then built a complete base in Havana. Returning to New York, he wrote more books and corresponded with his wife who traveled often to the Russian Empire to visit their daughter and her Russian husband. Four years after mustering out of the Army, Savage was knocked down and mortally wounded at the age of 57 by a horse and carriage on the streets of New York.",4.809

What is the minimum number of dimensions required for physical copies of the Socolar-Taylor tile to fit together without reflecting or rotating them?,39570044,"The Socolar–Taylor tile is a single non-connected tile which is aperiodic on the Euclidean plane, meaning that it admits only non-periodic tilings of the plane, with rotations and reflections of the tile allowed. It is the first known example of a single aperiodic tile, or ""einstein"". The basic version of the tile is a simple hexagon, with printed designs to enforce a local matching rule, regarding how the tiles may be placed. It is currently unknown whether this rule may be geometrically implemented in two dimensions while keeping the tile a connected set. This is, however, confirmed to be possible in three dimensions, and, in their original paper, Socolar and Taylor suggest a three-dimensional analogue to the monotile. Taylor and Socolar remark that the 3D monotile aperiodically tiles three-dimensional space. However the tile does allow tilings with a period, shifting one (non-periodic) two dimensional layer to the next, and so the tile is only ""weakly aperiodic"". Physical copies of the three-dimensional tile could not be fitted together without allowing reflections, which would require access to four-dimensional space.",1.962

The title track found the Swirling Eddies in search of the elusive Elvis Presley who, according to the song, escaped the city by faking his own death and decided to make his home in the wilderness. The song makes parallels between the search for Elvis, the search for Bigfoot and mankind's search for a king or ""savior."" This project gave the Swirling Eddies their first hit songs - ""Driving In England"" which made it all the way to #1 in some markets, and ""Hide the Beer, the Pastor's Here"" which also created a small amount of controversy for the album. The latter song tells the tale of a Christian College professor that hides his own hidden sins and attacks his students for their obvious drinking habits. At the end of the song, ""Spot"" shouts out the name of Christian Colleges around the United States. Some of these colleges were upset that they were mentioned in the song while others were upset that they weren't included. One song on the album, ""Mystery Babylon,"" had earlier been premiered on the Swirling Eddies Apology Video, which had been sent out to fans that ordered the Spittle & Phlegm video collection.

"What was the primary criterion prescribed by Christopher Alexander and his collaborators for making changes to any place, according to their book ""The Oregon Experiment""?",1585682,"The Oregon Experiment is a 1975 book by Christopher Alexander and collaborators Murray Silverstein, Shlomo Angel, Sara Ishikawa, and Denny Abrams. It describes an experimental approach to campus community planning at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon which resulted in a theory of architecture and planning described in the group's later published and better-known volumes A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way of Building. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, students and faculty at the University of Oregon protested against log trucks driving through campus; against the destruction of a 19th-century cemetery; against the military draft and the invasions and occupations in Southeast Asia; and against the idea that the university was acting in place of students' parents. On top of this, buildings created since the end of World War II included Brutalist architecture, which was aesthetically polarizing. The campus community wanted more control over their lives, and their environment. The university administration took the conciliatory measure of hiring an award-winning, radical professor from University of California, Berkeley, to design a process by which the community of the university could create its own space. The University of Oregon became the experimental testbed for material that later became the bestselling book A Pattern Language. The book prescribed that ""feeling"" should be the primary criterion used for making changes to any place. Improvements to the campus should be made first to those places that needed the most help. Patterns, or good solutions to generic problems, should be available in a community encyclopedia. Care should be taken to curb the economic and political power of large monolithic projects. Places should be shaped for people, to make them feel more whole, and to nourish them; and people should be involved in the construction of their community.",7.66

"What does it mean when a print is referred to as ""only state"", and how does this differ from the way authorities approach accidental damage to a matrix?",8387071,"In printmaking, a state is a different form of a print, caused by a deliberate and permanent change to a matrix such as a copper plate or woodblock. Artists often take prints from a plate and then do further work on the plate before printing more impressions (copies). Sometimes two states may be printed on the same day, sometimes several years may elapse between them. States are usually numbered in Roman numerals: I, II, III ..., and often as e.g.: ""I/III"", to indicate the first of three recorded states. Some recent scholars refine the work of their predecessors, without wishing to create a confusing new numbering, by identifying states such as ""IIa"", ""IVb"" and so forth. A print with no different states known is catalogued as ""only state"". Most authorities do not count accidental damage to a plate – usually scratches on a metal plate or cracks in a woodcut block – as constituting different states, partly because scratches can disappear again after being printed a number of times.",7.671

"What is the main objective behind a corporate tax inversion, and how does it allow a corporation to reduce its tax liability?",19667444,"A tax inversion or corporate tax inversion is a form of tax avoidance where a corporation restructures so that the current parent is replaced by a foreign parent, and the original parent company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign parent, thus moving its tax residence to the foreign country. Executives and operational headquarters can stay in the original country. The US definition requires that the original shareholders remain a majority control of the post-inverted company. In US federal legislation a company which has been restructured in this manner is referred to as an ""inverted domestic corporation"", and the term ""corporate expatriate"" is also used. The majority of the less than 100 material tax inversions recorded since 1993 have been of US corporations, seeking to pay less to the US corporate tax system. The only other jurisdiction to experience a material outflow of tax inversions was the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010; however, UK inversions largely ceased after the reform of the UK corporate tax code from 2009 to 2012. The first inversion was McDermott International in 1983. Reforms by US Congress in 2004 halted ""naked inversions"", however, the size of individual ""merger inversions"" grew dramatically; in 2014 alone, they exceeded the cumulative value of all inversions since 1983. New US Treasury rules in 2014–16 blocked several major inversions, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) further reduced the taxation incentives of inversions. As of June 2019, there have been no material US inversions post-2017, and notably, two large Irish-based tax inversion targets were acquired in non-tax inversion transactions, where the acquirer remained in their higher-tax jurisdiction: Shire plc by Japanese pharma Takeda for US$63 billion, and Allergan plc by U.S. pharma AbbVie for US$64 billion; in addition, Broadcom Inc. redomesticated to the United States. As of June 2019 the most popular destination in history for US corporate tax inversions is Ireland; Ireland was also the most popular destination for UK inversions. The largest completed corporate tax inversion in history was the US$48 billion merger of Medtronic with Covidien plc in Ireland in 2015. The largest aborted tax inversion was the US$160 billion merger of Pfizer with Allergan plc in Ireland in 2016. The largest hybrid-intellectual property (IP) tax inversion was the US$300 billion acquisition of Apple Inc.'s IP by Apple Ireland in 2015.",5.27

"What was the main organizational strategy behind Roots of Resistance's decision to limit membership to people of colour only, and how did this approach challenge the dominant culture within the radical left?",1315911,"Roots of Resistance was an anti-racist organization active in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from 1992 to 1996. The organization was formed shortly after a Vancouver demonstration in support of Rodney King during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, fusing an affinity group called Anarchists of Colour with Langara College's students of colour collective, the Third World Alliance, and other activists. Roots of Resistance was composed of people of colour only, with members of African, Asian, First Nations and Latin American ancestry, including people of mixed-race. Members of Roots of Resistance were of various left-wing political tendencies, from anarchism to Marxism, as well as divergent cultural and religious perspectives. Uniting the group was an anti-colonial and anti-capitalist critique, including support of First Nations sovereignty and opposition to global imperialism. Roots of Resistance also criticized parliamentary attempts to restrict immigration, and directly opposed neo-fascist activity, two important issues in early- to mid-1990s Canada. Roots of Resistance's people of colour-only membership was an organizational strategy developed to address racism from a position of strength and affinity, but also to reject what was seen as a white cultural hegemony within the radical left which effectively excluded people of colour and their perspectives. These various prejudices of the white-dominated left were essentially challenged by the founding of an allied group with an all brown membership. Roots of Resistance frequently worked in coalition with white allies, and was not a separatist organization, nor was it anti-white. Roots of Resistance's most newsworthy moments were its Anti-Canada Day demonstrations on 1 July, events designed to expose the colonialist and genocidal history of the Canadian state.",1.979

"What is the primary function of a parity drive in a RAID array, and how does it enable fault tolerance?",29613991,"A parity drive is a hard drive used in a RAID array to provide fault tolerance. For example, RAID 3 uses a parity drive to create a system that is both fault tolerant and, because of data striping, fast. Basically, a single data bit is added to the end of a data block to ensure the number of bits in the message is either odd or even. One way to implement a parity drive in a RAID array is to use the exclusive or, or XOR, function. XOR is a Boolean logic function which means 'one or the other, but not both'. The XOR of all of the data drives in the RAID array is written to the parity drive. If one of the data drives fails, the XOR of the remaining drives is identical to the data of the lost drive. Therefore, when a drive is lost, recovering the drive is as simple as copying the XOR of the remaining drives to a fresh data drive.",2.595

"What was the traditional way that many of the duties of a sacristan were performed in ancient times, according to historical records?",1338388,"A sacristan is an officer charged with care of the sacristy, the church, and their contents. In ancient times, many duties of the sacrist were performed by the doorkeepers (ostiarii), and later by the treasurers and mansionarii. The Decretals of Gregory IX speak of the sacristan as if he had an honourable office attached to a certain benefice, and say that his duty was to care for the sacred vessels, vestments, lights, etc. Nowadays the sacristan is elected or appointed. The Cæremoniale Episcoporum prescribed that in cathedral and collegiate churches the sacristan should be a priest, and describes his duties in regard to the sacristy, the Blessed Eucharist, the baptismal font, the holy oils, the sacred relics, the decoration of the church for the different seasons and feasts, the preparation of what is necessary for the various ceremonies, the pregustation in pontifical Mass, the ringing of the church bells, the preservation of order in the church, and the distribution of Masses; finally it suggests that one or two canons be appointed each year to supervise the work of the sacrist and his assistants. In the Old Testament, the office and duties of the sacristan are assigned to the Levites. 1 Chronicles 23-26 describes how David assigned them duties such as temple doorkeepers, guardians, singers and musicians.",2.976

"What is the significance of the Whiteshell River in relation to the Ojibwa peoples, according to the text?",4066324,"The Whiteshell River is one of the major rivers in Whiteshell Provincial Park, in southeastern Manitoba, Canada, near the Ontario border. This river is close to some petroform sites that are about 2000 years old or older. The name ""whiteshell"" is in reference to the Meegis or cowry shells used by Ojibwa peoples in their ceremonies and teachings, especially the Midewiwin, and as recorded in their birch bark scrolls. The river was used for thousands of years as a major canoe route by native peoples. The Winnipeg and Whiteshell Rivers are the only waterways to easily travel between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Superior. The copper culture period of about 4,000 years ago involved the trade of copper from the north shore of Lake Superior to the Whiteshell Provincial Park area and other areas now known as Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. Manitoba also has prehistoric quartz mines to the far north, and evidence of ancient quartz mining also exists along the Winnipeg River area. Quartz, copper, and other minerals were used to make prehistoric arrow heads, tools, scrapers, spears, and artwork. Whiteshell Provincial Park is still a popular area for wild rice harvesting, as it was for thousands of years. Today this river system area is popular for canoeing, hiking, swimming, fishing, boating, and many cottages are located along the lakes and rivers of the park. The geography and geology of the area consists of Canadian Shield granite rock ridges, cliffs, boreal forest, bogs, and only one main road through the park.

"What adaptations do Polposipus herculeanus beetles have to avoid predators, such as the Wright's Skink and the Seychelles magpie-robin, in their natural habitat?",12710099,"Polposipus herculeanus, the Frégate Island giant tenebrionid beetle or Frégate beetle, is a flightless species of beetle in family Tenebrionidae. It is endemic to Frégate Island in the Seychelles. It grows to be about 20–30 mm long and has a hard, rounded abdomen covered with tubercles. There appears to be no sexual dimorphism. They are largely arboreal, sheltering under the bark of trees, beneath the crooks of branches, and within bushes during the day. They are believed to be nocturnal, descending to the forest floor at night, though never travelling far. This behaviour may help them to avoid predators such as the Wright's Skink and the Seychelles magpie-robin. When in danger, chemicals will secrete from the defensive glands in the posterior of the beetle, which have a musky smell and stains the skin purple. In captivity they have been noted to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, bark, fungus and cat food. There are a few captive populations, taken for conservation reasons, the largest being at London zoo. These populations are the descendants of two small populations taken from the wild several years apart. It is quite possible that it previously lived on other islands in the Seychelles, and it has been suggested that it could be reintroduced to other islands to reduce its vulnerability. In captivity they have been recorded to live for up to seven years.",2.601

Bands in the genre emphasize complex and fluctuant rhythms through the use of irregular time signatures, polymeters, syncopations and tempo changes. Early mathcore lyrics were addressed from a realistic worldview and with a pessimistic, defiant, resentful or sarcastic point of view. In the 1990s, the hardcore punk scene started to embrace extreme metal openly. It also started to become highly ideological, with most of the popular bands being part of subcultures. This led to bands such as Converge, Botch, Coalesce and The Dillinger Escape Plan to establish the genre.",2.635

What was the primary reason why the Cornish miners and their families moved to Mount Pleasant in the mid-19th century?,28321136,"Mount Pleasant is the oldest residential suburb of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It is located on the southern extremity of the city between the Yarrowee Creek and the White Horse Range. Physically it is largely cut off from the rest of Ballarat which contributes to a sense of a suburb apart. The traditional Wathaurung country was first settled in 1836 when the Yuille brothers established a sheep run that included the sheltered corner under the escarpment later named Mount Pleasant. In those days, before there was a town at Ballarat, Buninyong was the nearest township. When the gold rush of 1851 brought thousands of diggers to nearby Golden Point, Mount Pleasant was left alone as no gold was initially found there. Its peacefulness made it attractive to a number of Cornish miners and their families who had come to Australia to settle permanently. These Wesleyans were the founders of the community. As devout and sober church people they sought a place to live away from the drunken mayhem of the diggings around Main Road. The converging lines of the main streets that lead into Mount Pleasant from the north follow the original tracks that connected it to the Main Road commercial area in the 1850s. In December 1854, on the gentle slope above the creek, the Cornish families set up their tents and established a school, a memorial to which can be found near the reserve. This quiet life was rudely disrupted in late 1856 when gold was found and for a few years Mount Pleasant itself suffered all the disturbances of a rush. The newer housing development beyond Elsworth Street is where much of the surface mining took place. There were several hotels near where the sewerage pipe now runs, When the alluvial gold ran out, the community settled down and its Methodist character reasserted itself. By the end of the century all the hotels had been closed. From the 1870s a string of Chinese market gardens were established along the creek. Humffray Street and even Morton Street were busy with shops. A very active community developed with sporting teams and cultural activities. The tent school soon became a well-attended denominational school next to the church. When the colonial government introduced free, compulsory and secular education, the Methodist school closed and in 1874 all 500 pupils marched to the new State School in Cobden Street, the first to be built in Ballarat. Until the 1970s Mount Pleasant was a largely self-contained community. It was the end of the line. From 1926 until 1972 an electric tram terminated at Bartles Corner, where there were two general stores, a post office, a butcher, a cake shop and a shoe repairer. Everyone shopped locally. With the closure of the church and the everyday shops, it is mainly the primary school, which traces its origins back to the beginning of Mount Pleasant as a suburb, which continues as a communal centre. The suburb is bordered by the Yarrowee River to the west, Gladstone Street to the north, Magpie and Britain Street to the east and Ballarat Goldfields to the south. While Mount Pleasant is organized primarily on a grid plan, the converging lines of some streets indicate their origins as tracks before the streets were made. The housing stock is solid but modest, with many Victorian era Single-family detached homes on larger than average blocks. There is some new industrial activity along Humffray Street below the reserve, where once there were several tanneries and a string of Chinese market gardens. The newer housing estate to the south of Elsworth Street is on the site of the alluvial gold rush of the late 1850s and traces of mining can still be seen. At the 2021 census, Mount Pleasant had a population of 2,225. A single bus service, the Buninyong connects Mount Pleasant to the city.",5.315
"What is the primary goal of the Princeton Prize in Race Relations, as stated in its mission?",6354304,"An awards program sponsored by Princeton University and principally undertaken by its alumni, the Princeton Prize in Race Relations (PPRR) honors high school age students who have done notable work in advancing the cause of race relations. The mission of the Princeton Prize is ""to identify and recognize high-school-age students who significantly engage and challenge their schools or communities to advance racial equity in order to promote respect and understanding among all people."" By recognizing, rewarding, and reinforcing the good work of students who are making a difference, the Princeton Prize hopes to promote better race relations now and to provide an impetus for other young people to work towards racial understanding in the future. The Princeton Prize was initiated in the 2003/04 academic year, with pilot programs in the Boston and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. The program has grown dramatically since that time and is now nationwide. Today, PPRR operates in 28 regions nationally and also has an At-Large region to support areas not currently supporting a regional committee. In 2022/2023 academic year, Princeton University hosted the 2023 Princeton Prize in Race Relations award winners, 29 high school students from across the United States, during the annual Princeton Prize Symposium on Race held on campus in April. The Princeton Prize in Race Relations is run by more than 400 Princeton alumni volunteers. Since its founding in 2003, it has awarded over 500 Prizes and more than 1500 Certificates of Accomplishment to high school students for their work in standing up to intolerance and encouraging connection and community. It is hoped that the Princeton Prize will ultimately evolve into a nationally recognized awards program to which any high school age student in the country can apply. Each of the Princeton Prize in Race Relations recipients receives an award of $1,000 and is invited to participate in a Symposium on Race. The Princeton Prize in Race Relations, together with a cash award of up to $1,000, is offered to those applicants doing the best work in each locale. In addition, other worthy applicants are honored with “Certificates of Accomplishment.” All honorees are recognized at their schools’ awards assemblies and at area-wide recognition events. The Princeton Prize in Race Relations is overseen by a national board consisting primarily of Princeton alumni, but also comprising Princeton University staff members and current undergraduates. The Princeton Prize Board is a committee of the Alumni Association of the Princeton University, the umbrella organization for all of Princeton's alumni activities. In addition, a local committee is established in each region where the Princeton Prize operates. These committees consist primarily – though not exclusively – of Princeton alumni. Other local committee members may include educators and other individuals who are involved in race related matters in their communities. The local committees operate under the aegis of the Princeton alumni club or association in each area. Currently sit on the National Board: Chair (2024): Steven D.

"What is the characteristic property that indicates the presence of flexirubin in a bacterial culture, and what are two alternative methods for verifying its presence?",50171479,"Flexirubin is the main pigment in the bacteria genera Flexibacter, Flavobacterium, Chryseobacterium, and Cytophaga. It was isolated for the first time from Flexibacter elegans. Flexirubin is found in these genera, as well as those that produce carotenoids. The pigment mixture of flexirubin and carotenoids imparts colonies with an intense yellow-orange color. Structurally, this bacteria pigment is based on a polycarboxylic-chromophore that is linked with a phenol by an ester, resulting in an alkyl side-chain. The first total synthesis of flexirubin was reported in 1977. To test for the presence of flexirubin, a cultural strain with a 20% potassium hydroxide solution is created. A color change from gold to red-brown indicates the presence of flexirubin. Alternatively, the pigment can also be extracted with acetone and chromatographic methods can be used to ascertain its presence.",3.014

"What is the primary advantage of using non-selective plates in a replica plating experiment, and how does this approach address concerns about the age or viability of cells on the original plate?",288307,"Replica plating is a microbiological technique in which one or more secondary Petri plates containing different solid (agar-based) selective growth media are inoculated with the same colonies of microorganisms from a primary plate, reproducing the original spatial pattern of colonies. The technique involves pressing a velveteen-covered disk, and then imprinting secondary plates with cells in colonies removed from the original plate by the material. Generally, large numbers of colonies are replica plated due to the difficulty in streaking each out individually onto a separate plate. The purpose of replica plating is to be able to compare the master plate and any secondary plates, typically to screen for a desired phenotype. For example, when a colony that was present on the primary plate, fails to appear on a secondary plate, it shows that the colony was sensitive to a substance on that particular secondary plate. Common screenable phenotypes include auxotrophy and antibiotic resistance. Replica plating is especially useful for ""negative selection"". However, it is more correct to refer to ""negative screening"" instead of using the term 'selection'. For example, if one wanted to select colonies that were sensitive to ampicillin, the primary plate could be replica plated on a secondary Amp+ agar plate. The sensitive colonies on the secondary plate would die but the colonies could still be deduced from the primary plate since the two have the same spatial patterns from ampicillin resistant colonies. The sensitive colonies could then be picked off from the primary plate. Frequently the last plate will be non-selective. In the figure, a nonselective plate will be replica plated after the Amp+ plate to confirm that the absence of growth on the selective plate is due to the selection itself and not a problem with transferring cells. If one sees growth on the third (nonselective) plate but not the second one, the selective agent is responsible for the lack of growth. If the non-selective plate shows no growth, one cannot say whether viable cells were transferred at all, and no conclusions can be made about the presence or absence of growth on selective media. This is particularly useful if there are questions about the age or viability of the cells on the original plate. By increasing the variety of secondary plates with different selective growth media, it is possible to rapidly screen a large number of individual isolated colonies for as many phenotypes as there are secondary plates. The development of replica plating required two steps. The first step was to define the problem: a method of identifiably duplicating colonies. The second step was to devise a means to reliably implement the first step. Replica plating was first described by Esther Lederberg and Joshua Lederberg in 1952.One of the nutrient agar plate will have antibiotic ressistance. Lederberg sought to use a fabric that was able to be sterilized, and had a vertical fabric pile, akin to a 2D analog ""wire brush"" of that had been classically used to transfer colonies. Paper was unsatisfactory as ""its lateral capillarity and its compression of the colonies distorted and broke up the original growth pattern."", and nylon velvet was too expensive and its stiffer fibers caused problems, leading to the choice and eventual standardization on cotton velveteen. While first demonstrated with bacteria, velveteen based replica plating has also become a standard technique in the microbiology of eukaryotes, such as yeast.",4.528

"What is the likely origin of the diderm cell envelope in the Negativicutes, according to some scientists, and what additional research is required to confirm this theory?",31883888,"The Negativicutes are a class of bacteria in the phylum Bacillota, whose members have a peculiar cell wall with a lipopolysaccharide outer membrane which stains gram-negative, unlike most other members of the Bacillota. Although several neighbouring Clostridia species also stain gram-negative, the proteins responsible for the unusual diderm structure of the Negativicutes may have actually been laterally acquired from Pseudomonadota. Additional research is required to confirm the origin of the diderm cell envelope in the Negativicutes. Most members of this class are obligate anaerobes, and occur in habitats such as rivers, lakes, and the intestines of vertebrates. They range from spherical forms, such as Megasphaera and Veillonella, to curved rods, as typified by the selenomonads. Selenomonas has a characteristic crescent shape, with flagella inserted on the concave side, while Sporomusa is similar, but nonmotile. Their names refer to this distinctive morphology: selene means moon, and musa means banana.",3.251

Many authorities include the Neotominae and Tylomyinae as part of a larger definition of Sigmodontinae. When those genera are included, the species count numbers at least 508. Their distribution includes much of the New World, but the genera are predominantly South American, such as brucies. They invaded South America from Central America as part of the Great American Interchange near the end of the Miocene, about 5 million years ago. Sigmodontines proceeded to diversify explosively in the formerly isolated continent. They inhabit many of the same ecological niches that the Murinae occupy in the Old World. The ""Thomasomyini"" from the Atlantic Forest of Brazil are generally thought to be not especially related to the ""real"" Thomasomyini from the northern Andes and the Amazon rainforest. The genera Wiedomys and Sigmodon are generally placed in their own tribe, and the ""phyllotines"" Irenomys, Punomys, Euneomys, and Reithrodon are considered incertae sedis. The name ""Sigmodontinae"" is based on the name of the type genus, Sigmodon.

Including these hamlets, Vijlen has around 1,500 inhabitants and is part of the municipality of Vaals. Located at 200 meters above Normaal Amsterdams Peil, on top of the Vijlenerberg, it is the highest situated town in the Netherlands. The neo-gothic and Catholic St. Martinus church, which is located in the center of the village, is known as the highest located church in the country. The area around the village is well known for its natural environment and landscapes. The 'Mergelland Route', a touristic route through the South-Limburg area, leads through the village and its surroundings. With lodging and camping facilities available, tourism related business is a key source of income for the village. The origin of the village is most likely Roman. The name Vijlen is generally believed to be derived from the Roman word 'villa' or 'villare'. Remains of a Roman villa have been found close to the village. The earliest known documentation on the village originates from 1016. Documentation of a gift to the abbey of Aachen-Burtscheidt in that year mentions property in Villiam (Uilliam).
In the adjoining forest, the 'Vijlener bos', evidence of much earlier human activity in the area has been found. Communal graves from the Linear Pottery culture have been recovered, and indicate human settlements in the area around 5000 years ago.",3.43

The editor for the entirety of Rails existence was Bob Stott QSM. Robin Bromby was managing editor from 1971 to 1975, at which time Bob and Jan Stott become the owners of the magazine. The magazine's existence spanned the final years of central government control of railways in New Zealand, corporatisation in the 1980s, privatisation of the railways in 1993 and finally the purchase of Tranz Rail by Toll Holdings followed by the renationalisation of the rail network in 2003. The magazine was initially printed by the Masterton Printing Company. In 1973 Robin Bromby established the Dunedin office, and the printing was transferred to Allied Press. There were some difficult moments and, in 1973, the partners agreed to close the magazine to prevent further losses.

The rescue was very much at quarter to midnight; the next edition was about to go to print and the inside cover contained the closure announcement. At the last moment, that announcement was pulled and a full-page photograph of an Invercargill tram substituted. The economics of the magazine were further underpinned by the decision by Stott and Bromby to begin publishing rail books and this ancillary business enabled the company to turn the corner. Rails and editor Bob Stott were often cited as authorities on rail-related subjects in the general news media. Stott continued to comment on railway-related matters after Rails ceased publication, and has had regular opinion columns published in Rails former competitor, Railfan.",2.704

The Greek Revival style church building was constructed in 1835 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is a one-story one-room wood-frame building with a gable roof, on stone piers. It is covered with weatherboard siding and has no exterior ornamentation. One reason the church was deemed significant is that it represents the former community of Church Hill. It is the only surviving structure of the community, which once had five churches plus an academy. It had a phone line in 1885 and it had a post office until 1903. Its NRHP nomination notes an association to the Christian Union faith:",2.774
"What was the main reason for the shutdown of the Holden Lixiviation Works facility in 1893, leading to its bankruptcy?",34247231,"The Holden/Marolt Mining and Ranching Museum is located on the former Holden Lixiviation Works facility on the western edge of the city of Aspen, Colorado, United States. It consists of two remaining buildings from the facility, as well as the relocated McMurchy/Zupancis domestic buildings. In 1990 the property was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the only district in the city to be so recognized. The museum is housed in the former sampling building, which was built in 1891 to process ore mined from the mountains around the city into silver through lixiviation. Within two years it had to be shut down when a change in U.S. government policy led to a huge drop in silver production and drove it into bankruptcy. The buildings remained standing and were eventually bought by a local rancher to expand. His family later sold them to the City of Aspen, which turned the property into an open space and leased the buildings to Aspen Historical Society, to operate as a museum.",2.786

What is unique about Uitvlugt compared to other villages in the Essequibo Islands-West Demerara region?,33062191,"Uitvlugt is a village in the Essequibo Islands-West Demerara region of Guyana. On the coastal public road on the west bank of the Demerara River, it lies immediately to the west of Stewartville and to the south of Zeeburg, about 20 minutes by road from Vreed-en-Hoop. The name is Dutch and translates to excuse/pretext, but in this case, it was the surname of Ignatius Uitvlugt, who owned an enormous sugar plantation. The plantation continued as a sugar estate and merged with the neighbouring Leonora estate in 1981. In 1871, the village became known for the sugar factory that is now owned by GuySuCo.

"What is the primary purpose of the Unique National Role (RUN) in Chile, aside from being an identification number for both citizens and foreign nationals?",58266569,"The Unique National Role (RUN) is a unique identification number given to every Chilean, resident or not in Chile, and any foreigner who remains, temporarily or permanently, with a visa other than the tourist visa in Chile. It was implemented in 1973. The agency in charge of granting the RUN is the Civil Registry and Identification Service, which grants it to those born in Chile at the time of registration of a birth. In all other cases, the RUN is granted at the time of requesting an identity card, a document of compulsory carriage for those over 18 years of age. The RUN was, until September 2013, the same as the Chilean passport number. The RUN is given in increasing order, therefore a person with a lower RUN is generally older, since most RUNs are given at birth. Legal persons – such as companies, international organizations, tax offices, NGOs, etc. – have a similar identification number, the Unique Tax Form (RUT), which is assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (SII) upon request. The RUN is also the Unique Tax Role of natural persons. The RUN and the RUT consist of two parts separated by a hyphen: the correlative number and the verifying digit or DV. The DV consists of a digit that goes from 0 to 9 or the letter K, which is obtained from the correlative via an algorithm. The DV validates the RUN or RUT, since this number can have only one verifying digit; this way mistakes in typing and deception are avoided. Normally, both the RUN and the RUT use separator points of thousands, so they obey the following format: XX.XXX.XXX-Y, where X is a digit and Y is a digit or the letter K.",2.792

"What is the main difference in the way glucose and PAH are processed by the proximal convoluted tubule of the nephron, and how does this affect their respective transport maximums?",8421235,"In physiology, transport maximum refers to the point at which increase in concentration of a substance does not result in an increase in movement of a substance across a cell membrane. In renal physiology, the concept of transport maximum is often discussed in the context of glucose and PAH. For both substances, the quantity excreted can be determined with the following equation: excretion = - reabsorption The proximal convoluted tubule of the nephron has protein channels that reabsorb glucose, and others that secrete para-aminohippuric acid (PAH). However, its ability to do so is proportionate to the channel proteins available for the transport. Glucose is not secreted, so excretion = filtration - reabsorption. Both filtration and reabsorption are directly proportional to the concentration of glucose in the plasma. However, while the average maximum reabsorption is about 375 mg/min in healthy individuals, filtration has effectively no limit Therefore, if the concentration rises above 375 mg/min, the body cannot retain all the glucose, leading to glucosuria.
PAH is not reabsorbed and is secreted, so excretion = filtration + secretion. As with glucose, the transfer is at the proximal tubule, but in the opposite direction: from the peritubular capillaries to the lumen. At low levels, all the PAH is transferred, but at high levels, the transport maximum is reached, and the PAH takes longer to clear. In practice, the transport maximum is not all-or-nothing. As the concentration approaches the transport maximum, some of the channels are overwhelmed before others are. For example, with glucose, some sugar appears in the urine at levels much lower than 300 mg/dL. The point at which the effects start to appear is called ""threshold"", and the difference between threshold and transport maximum is called ""splay"".",7.868
"What role does Kim Quy play in Vietnamese legends, and what are some of the significant events that involve this mythical golden turtle god?",67880009,"Kim Quy or Thanh Giang sứ giả is a mythical golden turtle god appearing in several Vietnamese legends. In one legend, he appears to the early Vietnamese ruler An Dương Vương and gives him one of his golden claws as a trigger for a magical crossbow with which An Dương Vương can kill 300 enemies with one shot. With it he is able to protect the kingdom. Later on, however, An Dương Vương's daughter marries his enemy's son and betrays the secret of the crossbow. Her husband secretly switches the trigger so that the crossbow no longer has any magical powers, and when his father attacks, An Dương Vương is forced to flee with his daughter. He flees far to the south, but always feels the enemy is right at his back. Kim Quy appears to him and tells him that his own daughter, riding on the horse behind him, is his enemy. An Dương Vương executes his daughter for her betrayal before drowning himself in the ocean. In another legend, Kim Quy appears to the Vietnamese emperor Lê Lợi (r.1428–1435) in The Green Water Lake in what is now Hanoi. Lê Lợi had led the Lam Sơn uprising against the Ming Dynasty, who had occupied Vietnam. According to the legend, the Dragon King, a local god, had aided Lê with a magical sword, Heavens’ Will, with which Lê was able to drive out the Chinese and establish the Later Lê dynasty. After his victory, Kim Quy appeared to Lê from out of the lake to take back the sword for the Dragon King. The emperor hands over the sword and Kim Quy disappears into the lake, which has ever since been called The Lake of the Returned Sword. The lake was, until very recently, home to the Hoan Kiem turtle, but the last one died in late 2015 or early 2016. The Turtle Tower on an island in the lake, commemorates the legend.",5.125

What is the primary difference between the Fourier transform and the fractional Fourier transform in mathematical physics and harmonic analysis?,65470508,"In mathematical physics and harmonic analysis, the quadratic Fourier transform is an integral transform that generalizes the fractional Fourier transform, which in turn generalizes the Fourier transform. Roughly speaking, the Fourier transform corresponds to a change of variables from time to frequency or from position to momentum. In phase space, this is a 90 degree rotation. The fractional Fourier transform generalizes this to any angle rotation, giving a smooth mixture of time and frequency, or of position and momentum. The quadratic Fourier transform extends this further to the group of all linear symplectic transformations in phase space. More specifically, for every member of the metaplectic group there is a corresponding quadratic Fourier transform.",5.126

What is the specific type of rock that Timdalia intricata typically grows on in Scandinavian locations?,72311537,"Timdalia is a fungal genus in the family Acarosporaceae. It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Timdalia intricata, a saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen. This species was first formally described by Swedish lichenologist Adolf Hugo Magnusson in 1935, based on a collection made by Eduard Frey in Austria. It was initially classified in the genus Acarospora. Josef Hafellner circumscribed Timdalia to contain the species in 2001. It was initially placed in the family Lecanoraceae, but molecular phylogenetic studies showed Timdalia to belong in the Acarosporaceae. The genus name honours Norwegian lichenologist Einar Timdal. Later collections of Timdalia intricata were made in the Austrian Alps, Italy, and various Scandinavian locations. In Scandinavia, the lichen is usually found at subalpine and alpine elevation ranges between 630 and 1,400 m, typically on vertical to overhanging rock faces, and on iron-containing silicate rocks.",5.42

Strøbek is considered one of the leading artists within the Danish super-realist art movement.  The super-realist art movement had its breakthrough in Danish art in the early 1970s and was influenced by American photo-realism. However, Strøbek had already begun to paint realistically in 1965, and his detailed realism was rooted in European art, i.e. the Italian Renaissance, Spanish Baroque, or the Danish Golden Age, rather than in the photograph.  Strøbek's technique is impeccable. His paintings are executed with a precision that makes them look like photographs. Strøbek's motifs are still lifes, landscapes, portraits and human figures. He has executed many portraits, notably three commissioned by the Danish queen Margrethe II. Often Strøbek uses the trompe-l'œil technique in his paintings combining his modern approach and motif view with a style mostly associated with the Baroque period. Strøbek has exhibited extensively both in Denmark and internationally.",7.962

"What was Nelson Yuan-Sheng Kiang's most significant contribution to the field of audiology, and how did his work lead to advances in cochlear implantation and understanding of hearing disorders?",17582359,"Nelson Yuan-Sheng Kiang was the founder and former director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratory of Auditory Physiology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and professor emeritus of Otology and Laryngology at the Harvard Medical School and also professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also emeritus in Neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and a trustee of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Kiang received his Ph.D. in biopsychology from the University of Chicago in 1955, with William D. Neff as his advisor, and he has many notables in the auditory field among his ex-students. He received an honorary M.D. from the University of Geneva. He arrived at MIT in 1955 and in 1958, Dr. Kiang partnered with Amelia Peabody to establish the Eaton-Peabody Laboratory (EPL) at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Dr. Kiang served as laboratory director until 1996 and would oversee its rapid growth into the largest research group in the world dedicated to the study of hearing and deafness. In 1992 he founded the Speech and Hearing Sciences Program which he directed until he retired. His former student M. Charles Liberman replaced him as director of the EPL. Kiang was an honorary or advisory professor at four Chinese universities and advised people in five ministries in China. After retirement, his interests were in world health and world education. Kiang recounts the early history of the EPL in a memoir that is part of the EPL history project. Kiang has been credited as the first to demonstrate the auditory brainstem response, and to propose using such electrical signals from the brain to diagnose hearing disorders. In the early 1960s, as a pioneering researcher on sound coding in the auditory nerve, Kiang proposed the possibility of translating sound into multi-channel electrical signals as a way to give a sense of hearing to people with cochlear deafness – that is, cochlear implants.
In the early 1970s, after cochlear implantation experiments on humans had started with single-channel devices, Kiang strongly supported those urging caution with such human experimentation, arguing that our knowledge of coding in the auditory system was not yet sufficient and that single-channel devices were not up to the task. Both single- and multi-channel experimentation continued, and human experimentation along with continued auditory research led to advances that support success with modern multi-channel cochlear implants. In the 1990s, Kiang suggested investigating the response of the vestibular part of the inner ear to very low frequencies in relation to wind turbine syndrome.",3.478
What is the biological concept that determines the application of a scientific name to an animal taxon under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Code)?,26020588,"Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Code), the name-bearing type or onomatophore is the biological type that determines the application of a name. Each animal taxon regulated by the Code at least potentially has a name-bearing type. The name-bearing type can be either a type genus, type species, or one or more type specimens. For example, the name Mabuya maculata has often been used for the Noronha skink, but because the name-bearing type of the former, a lizard preserved in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, does not represent the same species as the Noronha skink, the name maculata cannot be used for the latter.",3.495

From a Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing approach to statistical inferences, the data obtained by comparing the p-value to a significance level will yield one of two results: either the null hypothesis is rejected, or the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at that significance level. From a Fisherian statistical testing approach to statistical inferences, a low p-value means either that the null hypothesis is true and a highly improbable event has occurred or that the null hypothesis is false.",3.499

"Here's a question based on the provided text:

What was Yann Marti's reason for leaving the Swiss Davis Cup team during a tie against Belgium, and how did this sudden departure affect the team's performance?",43609201,"Yann Marti is a Swiss tennis player. His highest ranking is World No. 200, which was achieved on 18 August 2014. In September 2014, Yann Marti was called as fifth player and sparring partner for the Davis Cup semifinal Switzerland-Italy in Geneva together with Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Marco Chiudinelli, and Michael Lammer. Although Marti ranked as the fourth Swiss player on the ATP, Lammer was preferred due to his qualities as doubles player. He had won the doubles partnering Chiudinelli in the first round in Serbia. Swiss Severin Lüthi said that due to the importance of the game against Italy, he would not proceed with any experiment with new players at this stage. Marti was allowed to wear the team uniform for the first time, and he stayed with the team during the whole week. Marti came very close to a nomination for the Davis Cup Final 2014 against France, when Federer was uncertain due to a back injury. Marti stayed in Switzerland, but was put on standby by the Swiss captain, in case he needed to replace Federer. He might have been preferred to Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer, due to his better track record on clay. However, Federer's condition improved, and Marti was not nominated. In 2015, Marti was called to play the first round of the Davis Cup in Belgium as the team leader after Federer and Wawrinka decided not to play and after Chiudinelli was injured. He practiced during the whole week with the team but when the captain announced that Marti would not play the Friday singles, Marti decided to go back home to Switzerland and left the team. He said to the media that the fact that he was not picked for the singles was ""the biggest disappointment of his career"" and that it was better to go home now as he must play some ITF Future tournaments and as he would anyway not be of any help for the team at this stage. However, the Swiss Federation released a press statement according to which Marti was excluded from the team by the captain due to his bad behaviour after the draw. The true reasons for Marti's exclusion remain unclear, but his sudden leave was heavily criticized in Switzerland, as he left the team at very short notice and left them with only 3 available players for the tie. Rumors of a physical altercation between Marti and Marco Chiudinelli started to circulate. Chiudinelli would have then informed the team captain that there was a ""problem"" with Marti. Wawrinka, who was not part of the team in Belgium, commented the events on his Twitter account by saying that ""Marti talks too much"". Roger Federer stated that he was briefed after the tie by the team captain and that Marti's behaviour was not acceptable and that it was very disappointing to see such things happen as it harmed the team. Switzerland lost the tie 3-2 and had to play the last decisive rubber with Adrien Bossel, a player ranked lower than Marti. The president of the Swiss Federation, René Stammbach, was extremely upset about Marti's behaviour and confirmed that Severin Lüthi had given the guarantee to Marti that he would have played on Sunday, which makes Marti's departure even less understandable. Stammbach further stated that ""As long as I am president, Marti will never be called again for the Davis Cup."" In parallel, Marti's father and coach Jean-Marie attacked the Swiss Federation through the media and said that it was a matter of money and that the team was against Marti and still owes him money for his role as sparring partner in 2014. The Federation vehemently denied the claims of the Marti family. Marti was never called again for the Davis Cup.",3.514

The system comprises an integrated suite of active and passive sonar systems including bow, fin, flank and towed arrays. Known components include: Type 2077 Parian obstacle avoidance sonar
Type 2081 environmental monitor
Type 2094 oceanographic sonar
Type 2079 active-passive bow sonar
Type 2078 fire control bow element
Type 2065 towed array
Flank array Support systems include command consoles, upgraded radio communications, upgraded signature reduction, and new flexi couplings to reduce self noise. Sonar 2076 is designed to be fitted into both the new Astute-class submarine and the existing Trafalgar-class submarine, allowing the Royal Navy's entire submarine fleet to have a common sonar system. BAE Systems, which is responsible for building the Astute-class submarines and integrating the Type 2076 Sonar, claims that the 2076 represents a ""step change"" over previous sonars and is the world's most advanced and effective sonar system. It is said to have 13,000 hydrophones, many times the number fitted in previous Royal Navy systems and more than any other submarine sonar in the world. A key development is the use of high performance and easily upgradeable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processing systems, allowing the introduction of much more sophisticated algorithms compared to earlier sonars. The processing power of the system is said to be equivalent to 60,000 home PCs.

"What is the primary member organization for radio reading services, and which countries does it serve?",1440020,"A radio reading service or reading service for the blind is a public service of many universities, community groups and public radio stations, where a narrator reads books, newspapers and magazines aloud for the benefit of the blind and vision-impaired. It is typically broadcast on a subcarrier, with radio receivers permanently tuned to a given station in the area, or an HD Radio subchannel of the offering station. Some reading services use alternative methods for reaching their audiences, including broadcasting over SAP, streaming Internet radio, cable TV, or even terrestrial TV. The International Association of Audio Information Services (IAAIS) serves as the primary member organization for radio reading services, and has member services or has consulted with and assisted local organizations in Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Panama, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The first radio reading service in the United States was the Minnesota Radio Talking Book Network, started in 1969 by C. Stanley Potter and Robert Watson. After six years of researching the concept, a Kansas philanthropist learned of the Minnesota service, and with their help in 1971 Petey Cerf founded Audio-Reader, the second reading service in the nation, in Lawrence, Kansas. In the late 1970s, Audio-Reader director Rosie Hurwitz and Stan Potter served as the first two presidents of the Association of Radio Reading Services, which came to be known as the National Association of Radio Reading Services, and, finally, IAAIS. The first radio reading service in Canada was founded by Richard Moses and Gordon Norman in Oakville, Ontario, in the basement of the Woodside Branch of the Oakville Public Library in the mid-1970s. In the United States, many public radio stations carry a local or regional reading service on an FM subcarrier. They are commonly affiliated with universities, libraries and other non-profit institutions. Reception of these stations require a special receiver, available at no cost to the listener, though most organizations require certification that the potential listener is unable to use normal printed material. Stations in other countries also carry such a service in this fashion. Some radio reading services are broadcast on standard FM stations. WRBH in New Orleans was the first full-time open channel radio reading service, although WRKC in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania has been broadcasting a two-hour-a-day service, the Radio Home Visitor, since 1974. WYPL in Memphis, Tennessee, run by volunteers of the Memphis Public Library, devotes nearly its entire broadcast day to a mixture of live readings and prerecorded readings overnight. Australia's Radio Print Handicapped Network has stations in all capital cities and some other areas. The first internet-based reading service was Assistive Media, founded in 1996 by David Erdody in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Most of the over 100 audio information services in the U.S. stream their broadcasts live on the internet, and some offer online archives of previously broadcast programming. Some organizations provide their listeners with internet radios preprogrammed to easily find the internet stream.",3.618

Spirit Lake's application was accepted for a grant for $8,000 on February 1, 1905. The search for a lot for the building delayed construction. The library was dedicated on September 24, 1912. The single-story brick structure was built on a raised basement, and features vaguely Tudor Revival elements. The center frontispiece and the tall windows give it a sense of verticality. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The public library has subsequently been relocated into a new building, and the historic building has been converted into commercial space.",4.905

What percentage of primary battery sales are accounted for by silver oxide primary batteries in Japan?,2165075,"A silver oxide battery is a primary cell using silver oxide as the cathode material and zinc for the anode. These cells maintain a nearly constant nominal voltage during discharge until fully depleted. They are available in small sizes as button cells, where the amount of silver used is minimal and not a prohibitively expensive contributor to the overall product cost. Silver oxide primary batteries account for 30% of all primary battery sales in Japan. Large silver oxide batteries were used on early ICBM's and satellites because of their high energy-to-weight ratio. For example the Corona reconnaissance satellites used them, as did the Agena-D rocket upper stage. Later, they were also used in the Apollo Lunar Module and lunar rover.",5.788

This affected for example, the Paderborn–Holzminden and Betzdorf–Siegen routes. A larger boiler could be used due to the front carrying axle. Like the G 7.2, the G 7.3 was designed as a compound locomotive. A total of only fifteen of these locomotives were built between 1893 and 1895, all of them by Hanomag; this was due to and increase in the permissible axle loads meant that the cheaper G 7.1s, without a front carrying axle, could also travel on these routes. In World War I this type was remembered because there was a need for simple locomotives with a low axle load, and production was resumed. Another 70 locomotives were built by J. A. Maffei, Krauss and Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. They differed from the earlier series, among other thinks, with a higher boiler pressure of 14 kgf/cm2 and a feedwater heater.

"What is the primary difference between Shannon coding and Huffman coding, according to the given information?",44942260,"In the field of data compression, Shannon coding, named after its creator, Claude Shannon, is a lossless data compression technique for constructing a prefix code based on a set of symbols and their probabilities. It is suboptimal in the sense that it does not achieve the lowest possible expected code word length like Huffman coding does, and never better than but sometimes equal to the Shannon–Fano coding. The method was the first of its type, the technique was used to prove Shannon's noiseless coding theorem in his 1948 article ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"", and is therefore a centerpiece of the information age. Shannon–Fano coding methods gave rise to the field of information theory and without its contributions, the world would not have any of the many successors; for example Huffman coding, or arithmetic coding. Much of our day-to-day lives are significantly influenced by digital data and this would not be possible without Shannon-Fano coding and the ongoing evolution of its methods. In Shannon coding, the symbols are arranged in order from most probable to least probable, and assigned codewords by taking the first l i = ⌈ − log 2 ⁡ p i ⌉ bits from the binary expansions of the cumulative probabilities ∑ k = 1 i − 1 p k .

"Here's a question based on the given sentence:

What is the primary characteristic that defines a material as a mesocrystal, regardless of how it was formed?",34745933,"A mesocrystal is a material structure composed of numerous small crystals of similar size and shape, which are arranged in a regular periodic pattern. It is a form of oriented aggregation, where the small crystals have parallel crystallographic alignment but are spatially separated. When the sizes of individual components are at the nanoscale, mesocrystals represent a new class of nanostructured solids made from crystiallographically oriented nanoparticles. The sole criterion for determining whether a material is mesocrystal is the unique crystallographically hierarchical structure, not its formation mechanism.",3.809
"What is the mechanism by which liquid capacitive inclinometers measure changes in direction, and how does it relate to the effect of gravity?",7699045,"Liquid capacitive inclinometers are inclinometers whose sensing elements are made with a liquid-filled differential capacitor; they sense the local direction of acceleration due to gravity. A capacitive inclinometer has a disc-like cavity that is partly filled with a dielectric liquid. One of the sides of the cavity has an etched conductor plate that is used to form one of the conductors of a variable parallel plate capacitor. The liquid along with the other side of the cavity forms the other plate of the capacitor. In operation, the sensor is mounted so that the disc is in a vertical plane with its axis horizontal. Gravity then acts on the liquid pulling it down in the cavity forming a semicircle. As the sensor is rotated the liquid remains in this semicircular pattern covering a different area of the etched plate. This change in area results in a change in the capacitance. The change in capacitance is then electronically converted into an output signal that is linear with respect to the input angle.",8.074

Shankar applied to the High Court for judicial review on the ground that the Committee's ruling was affected by apparent bias. Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon considered the differences between two commonly used tests for apparent bias: the ""real likelihood"" and ""reasonable suspicion"" tests. He held that there were notable differences between the two tests, contrary to the previous view taken by a different High Court judge in Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2005). He took the view that the reasonable suspicion test was the applicable test in Singapore. Two other legal issues were also considered, namely, whether the Disciplinary Committee had applied the wrong standard of proof, and whether it had shown a sufficient degree of detachment.

"What motivates Paul Averhoff, a fictional Olympic marathon champion, to start training to run again and participate in the Berlin Marathon after being forced into retirement life?",52944217,"Back on Track is a 2013 German tragicomedy film directed by Kilian Riedhof about fictional Olympic marathon champion Paul Averhoff who tries to escape the monotony of his old-age life in a retirement home by training to run again and participating in the Berlin Marathon. Well-known German comedian Dieter Hallervorden takes the leading role, Heike Makatsch plays his daughter. Paul Averhoff, a Berlin-based runner legend of the 1950s and marathon winner at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, has to move into a retirement home at an advanced age at the urging of his daughter Birgit and his sick wife Margot, because Margot needs professional care. Until then, the Averhoffs had been running their own house and property, and the dreary life in the nursing home means a major change for Paul. With the kindergarten-like occupational therapy offered by the well-meaning home director, he even fears ""handicrafting himself to death"". In order to escape this suddenly dull everyday life, Paul starts with running exercises in the nursing home's park. When other residents ask him why he is doing this, he spontaneously announces that he wants to participate in the Berlin Marathon. Despite some misgivings, Margot becomes his trainer again---as many decades before. Some residents, but especially the home's management, express resistance because Paul's obstinacy is disrupting the usual procedures. However, when one of the residents remembers his Olympic victory and even finds an old autograph card, the home's residents split into supporters and opponents of the project. A race in the park against the young male nurse Tobias, spontaneously suggested by Paul in an argument, is surprisingly won by Paul after an initial delay, because he is better able to manage his energies. But the resistance on the part of the home management becomes so strong that the Averhoffs decide to move into the city flat of their (protesting) daughter. A few days before the marathon, Margot dies of a brain tumour, after which Paul, brought back to the home after a fierce argument with Birgit, suffers a violent mourning attack. As a result, he is sedated and restrained in his bed. On the day of the marathon, however, Paul is freed by nurse Tobias and one of the residents who was previously his harshest critic, and driven to the start of the marathon. During the run, TV reports about him as ""the most incredible comeback in sports history"". Birgit also learns about her father's participation in the race and arrives in the afternoon with her boyfriend and all the nursing home residents in the stands of the Olympiastadion where Paul, albeit with a large gap, crosses the finish line and is celebrated by the audience. An epilogue ""one year later"" shows Paul taking part in a family party at his daughter's, cradling his grandchild and looking at a photograph of Margot.",5.952

What property do two integral quadratic forms need to have in order to be considered in the same genus?",36597629,"In mathematics, the genus is a classification of quadratic forms and lattices over the ring of integers. An integral quadratic form is a quadratic form on Zn, or equivalently a free Z-module of finite rank. Two such forms are in the same genus if they are equivalent over the local rings Zp for each prime p and also equivalent over R. Equivalent forms are in the same genus, but the converse does not hold. For example, x2 + 82y2 and 2x2 + 41y2 are in the same genus but not equivalent over Z. Forms in the same genus have equal discriminant and hence there are only finitely many equivalence classes in a genus. The Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula gives the weight or mass of the quadratic forms in a genus, the count of equivalence classes weighted by the reciprocals of the orders of their automorphism groups.",5.1

"What inspired the change of name from ""Boggabilla Hotel"" to ""Wobbly Boot Hotel"" at this Australian pub?",73895380,"The Wobbly Boot Hotel is an Australian pub located in the town of Boggabilla near the state border of New South Wales and Queensland. The current concrete building was constructed in 1935 to replace a 12-room wooden hotel on the same site that was destroyed by fire in 1934, leaving the railhead town without visitor accommodation. The new hotel was designed with modern amenities including electric lighting throughout, large balconies and a septic tank system to help take advantage of the business opportunities brought by the recently opened Boggabilla railway line. Originally known as the Boggabilla Hotel, the name was changed to the Wobbly Boot, an Australian slang term used to describe the sensation of being drunk and unable to walk straight, during the tenure of publican Glen Bryan in the early 1980s. In 1989, the Wobbly Boot Hotel was damaged after a fight outside the pub sparked a riot amid racial tensions related to the living conditions of Indigenous Australians at nearby Toomelah Station. Additional police were called from the towns of Moree and Goondiwindi and 11 people were charged. The Wobbly Boot has featured regularly in Australian media and travel blogs on lists of strange and iconic Australian pubs owing to its unusual name and notoriety as the inspiration for the Stan Coster song The Wobbly Boot Hotel.",5.286

"What are some common causes of mistuning, as discussed in both music and mechanics contexts?",3148880,"In music mistuning is most generally the action of incorrectly tuning or the state of being out of tune. Mistuning is also the displacement of a pitch a semitone away from its standard position in a stable tonal structure such as the most common perfect fourth or fifth, which mistuned in the opposite directions produce a tritone. A portion of the alpha chord:E-G-C-E♭, may be considered an E major chord: E-G♯-B-E, whose members are mistuned. See: alteration and chord substitution. In mechanics mistuning is a lack of symmetry present in a real object that ideally is perfectly symmetric. This phenomenon is studied in relation to turbine disks, for example; it can cause an increase of the forced response that can bring about unexpected failures due to fatigue. Mistuning is caused by manufacturer tolerances, non-homogeneity of the material, the usage, etc., and so it is unavoidable. It has been observed that the amount of increase in the forced response of mistuned turbine disks strongly depends on the physical characteristics of the disk itself: actual efforts to limit the negative effects of this phenomenon upon turbine disks focus on understanding how to design a disk that is influenced minimally by mistuning in the working rotational speed.",2.345

What significant consequence did Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts's decision have, according to historians?",19287838,"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of state minimum wage legislation. The court's decision overturned an earlier holding in Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923) and is generally regarded as having ended the Lochner era, a period in American legal history during which the Supreme Court tended to invalidate legislation aimed at regulating business. The case arose when hotel maid Elsie Parrish sued for the difference between her wages and the minimum wage set by the State of Washington. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes upheld the law, ruling that the Constitution permitted the restriction of liberty of contract by state law where such restriction protected the community, health and safety, or vulnerable groups. Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts's decision to join the majority in upholding the law after having favored striking down a state minimum wage law in another case has occasionally been referred to as ""the switch in time that saved nine"" because it occurred during the debate over the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937.",5.1
"Here's a question based on the given sentence:

What is the role of a ""vanishing mediator"" in facilitating conflict resolution, and how has this concept been applied across various fields such as Hegelian dialectics, psychoanalytic theory, political history, cultural studies, literature, and qualitative research?",11401784,"A vanishing mediator is a concept that exists to mediate between two opposing ideas, as a transition occurs between them. This mediating concept exists just long enough to facilitate such an interaction: at the point where one idea has been replaced by the other, the concept is no longer required and thus vanishes. In terms of Hegelian dialectics the conflict between the theoretical abstraction and its empirical negation is resolved by a concretion of the two ideas, representing a theoretical abstraction taking into account the previous contradiction, whereupon the mediator vanishes. In terms of psychoanalytic theory, when someone is caught in a dilemma they experience hysteria. A conceptual deadlock exists until the resulting hysteric breakdown precipitates some kind of resolution, therefore the Hysteria is a vanishing mediator in this case. In terms of political history, it refers to social movements, which operate in a particular way to influence politics, until they either are forgotten or change their purpose. Fredric Jameson introduced the term in a 1973 essay. Alain Badiou uses a similar, but more explicitly post-structuralist term in Théorie du sujet. Since, this concept has been adopted by Žižek in ""For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political factor"", where he uses it in a political sense, similar to Marx's Analysis of Revolution. Applications of this concept exist in various fields, making it a viable framework in cultural studies, literature, and qualitative research among others. One application is provided, for instance, by Balibar in his argument of Europe as a vanishing mediator.",3.177

"What is the primary function thought to be served by the pangaré coat trait found in horses, wild equids, and donkeys?",18155283,"Pangaré is a coat trait found in some horses that features pale hair around the eyes, muzzle, and underside of the body. These pale areas can extend up to the flanks, throat and chest, behind the elbows, in front of the stifle, and up the buttock. Animals with the pangaré trait are sometimes called ""mealy"" or ""light-pointed"". The color of these lighter areas depends on the underlying color and ranges from off-white to light tan. This type of coloration is most often found in breeds such as the Fjord horse, Exmoor Pony, and Haflinger. Wild equids like the Przewalski's Horse, Onager, African Wild Ass, Kiang as well as the domestic donkey exhibit pangaré as a rule. Pangaré is thought to be a type of protective countershading.
Horse foals are often born with ""foal pangaré"" or light points, especially over black haired areas, which they lose when they shed their foal coats. At one time, the seal brown coat color was hypothesized to occur from the action of pangaré on a black coat. However, this has been disproven; seal brown horses are a variation of the bay color. In donkeys, no light points is caused by a recessive missense mutation at agouti. The light points (pangare) color is similar to the light bellied agouti color in mice, while the no light points color is similar to recessive black in mammals. In light bellied agouti mice, the agouti mRNA starts with a different noncoding exon depending on whether it is made in the dorsal or ventral region. This leads to a lighter belly color in mice and probably other mammals as well.",2.355

Males are usually 2.5–3.5mm in length, females 4-6mm. They are predators, and eat various species of insects. Unlike many spiders, they do not spin a web of any kind. Instead, they prowl on the ground, as well as climbing plants and flowers, to find their prey. They can move forwards, backwards, and sideways. Runcina grammica has reportedly been sighted in various areas of Southeastern Spain and Southwestern Portugal. They are also known to inhabit Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Caucasus, Italy, India, South Africa, St. Helena, Turkey, France, and in the Carpathian Basin.

"What was the significance of October 12 in ancient Roman culture, and how did it relate to Augustus, the first Roman emperor?",1595376,"The Augustalia, also known as the Ludi Augustales, was a festival celebrated October 12 in honor of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. It was established in conjunction with an altar to Fortuna Redux to mark the return of Augustus from Asia Minor to Rome in 19 BC. The pontiffs and Vestals conducted sacrifices, and the date became a holiday (feria) on the official religious calendar of Rome. The altar to Fortuna Redux was inaugurated on October 12, 19 BC, but dedicated on December 15. Until Augustus died in 14 AD, Fortuna Redux was the recipient of the day's religious honors, and the name Augustalia does not appear in sources before that time. During his lifetime, Augustus was honored with ludi Augustales, games (ludi) presented on the initiative of individual magistrates. Strictly speaking, the Augustalia was the anniversary sacrifice, though Augustalia can also refer to commemorations of Augustus on his birthday, September 23. Augustus lists the establishment of the festival in his posthumously published first-person account of his achievements (Res Gestae), emphasizing that it takes its name from his cognomen. Roman festivals were often named for the deities they honored, and the unstated implication was that Augustus was to be accorded divine status. The establishment of the Augustalia thus marks a major development in what was to become Imperial cult. The Augustalia, abbreviated as AVG, appears on calendars in large, capital letters like some of the oldest festivals for deities of Rome's archaic religion. It occurs between the Meditrinalia and the Fontinalia, both of great antiquity.",5.297

"What year did Nezak Tarkhan lead a revolt against the Umayyad general Qutaiba ibn Muslim, and what was the outcome of this rebellion?",66074209,"Nezak Tarkhan was a nomadic ruler of Tokharistan who led a revolt against the Arab commander Qutayba bin Muslim around 709 CE. Nezak Tarkhan is first mentioned in 651 CE as the Hephthalite ruler of Badghis, when he allied with the marzban of Merv against the Sasanian ruler Yazdegerd III. Yazdegerd III was defeated and barely escaped with his life, but he was murdered in the vicinity of Merv soon after, and the Arabs managed to capture the city of Merv the same year. In 659, Chinese chronicles still mentioned the ""Hephtalite Tarkhans"", as some of the rulers in Tokharistan who remained theoretically subjects to the Chinese Empire, and whose main city was Huolu 活路. Yaqut al-Hamawi called Badghis ""the headquarters of the Hephthalites"". Thâbit and Hurayth ibn Qutba, who were brothers and leaders of the merchant community of Merv, allied with Arab rebel and ruler of Termez, Musa ibn Abd Allah ibn Khazim, who was the son of the Zubayrid governor of Khurasan Abd Allah ibn Khazim al-Sulami, against the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate. This alliance expanded to include Nezak, as well as the Hepthalite princes of Transoxiania and Tukharistan. They rebelled and Musa drove out the Umayyads from Transoxiania. While Musa's allies suggested to him to conquer all of Khorasan, his Arab allies told him to only take over Transoxiana, which he achieved. The Umayyad forces under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab however defeated this alliance, defeating Nezak in Badghis in 703 and capturing Termez from Musa in 704. Nezak Tarkhan, the ruler of the Hephthalites of Badghis, led a new revolt in 709 with the support of other principalities as well as his nominal ruler, the Yabghu of Tokharistan. In 710, the Umayyad general Qutaiba ibn Muslim was able to re-establish Muslim control over Tokharistan and captured Nizak Tarkhan, who was executed on the orders of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, despite promises of pardon, while the Yabghu was exiled to Damascus and kept there as a hostage. According to some authors, he may have been of Nezak descent and ""Nezak Tarkhan"" was a title of multiple rulers encountered by the Muslims rather than a personal name.",8.189
What was the main reason why VR did not accept the Dm11 trains for regular traffic in Finland?,32549197,"The Dm11 was a diesel multiple unit built by GEC-Alsthom in Spain for VR Group. A total of 16 units were ordered in 1995, with an option of 16 more, at a price of 80 million Finnish marks. The first units arrived in Finland in February 1997 and testing started in Central Finland a month later. However, VR cancelled the deal at the end of the same year. By that time, six units had been delivered. The trains left Finland in 1999. One of the units was later seen in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2000 before they were sold to Cuba. The train was unofficially called the Mandolino, which rhymed with the then-new Pendolino. VR did not accept the Dm11 in regular traffic for multiple reasons. It was claimed to weigh 37.7 tonnes during ordering, but the final units were 9 t overweight. This caused a problem, as the units were expected to run on lower quality tracks. The noise level in the passenger compartments was also measured to be 12 dB louder than expected. Furthermore, the windows of the train froze during winter service. The black ends of the train were seen as a hazard for drivers, and yellow was added to the nose of unit 4401 to increase visibility. VR started a new tender in December 1997, asking for 12–20 trains and a maximum of 20 options. However, the winner of the bid could not deliver trains that fitted the specifications, which meant that VR had to start from scratch once again at the end of the year 1998. Only three bids were entered, none of which interested the company. It started a new tender at the end of the year 1999 with the same requirements. Finally, CKD Vagonka won the bid in 2001 with a DMU that was to be called the Dm12. The unit numbers of the Dm11 were reused on Dm12 trains.",3.003

"What was the name given to poems written in the trochaic septenarius metre by ancient Greeks, while those same poems were referred to as ""trochaic septenarius"" in Latin literature?",30661443,"In ancient Greek and Latin literature, the trochaic septenarius is a form of ancient poetic metre first used in 7th century BC Greek literature. It was one of the two most common metres of Roman comedy of the early 1st century BC and was also used for the marching songs sung by soldiers at Caesar's victory parade. After a period when it was little used, it is found again in the Pervigilium Veneris, and taken up again as a metre for Christian hymns. The same metre, with stress-rhythm replacing quantitative metre, has continued to be used, especially for hymns and anthems, right up to the present day. The Ancient Greeks called poems in this metre simply ""tetrameters"", while the name ""trochaic septenarius"" is used for Latin poems in the metre. The basic metre consists of 15 syllables alternating strong and weak. The Greek version of the metre is as follows: The Latin form of the metre, as used in Roman comedy, was as follows: In Roman comedy it is very common for a long or anceps element to be resolved, that is, replaced by two short syllables, except at the end of the half line or line.

What was the outcome of William Fuller Maitland's death in 1876 regarding the construction of Stansted Hall?,31332981,"Stansted or Steanstead Hall is located in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, East of England, United Kingdom. It was the country seat of the Earls of Essex during the reign of Henry VIII of England. The Tudor-era Stansted Hall was partially destroyed by fire. So in the early 1660s Sir Thomas Myddleton built a new hall, a massive Jacobean four-story building with two large domed-shaped towers. The older Tudor hall remained standing nearby until at least 1770. The famous landscape designer Humphry Repton produced one of his ‘red books’ of designs for Stansted in 1791. Ebenezer Maitland (1780-1858) married Miss Berthia Ellis (1780-1863), the granddaughter of William Fuller (d.1800), a London banker. When his wife’s maiden aunt Sarah Fuller, William’s only surviving heiress, died in 1810, left all she possessed to the couple – a substantial fortune estimated at £500,000 – stipulating that Ebenezer assume the surname Fuller Maitland. So Stansted Hall became the property of the Fuller Maitland family. The manor house that stands today was begun in 1871 by William Fuller Maitland and completed in 1876 following his death, adding some elements recovered from the surviving Jacobean tower of the previous manor hall. The Fuller-Maitland family owned Stansted Hall for many decades, until William Fuller-Maitland sold the estate in 1921. James Arthur Findlay bought the estate in 1923 from Sir Albert Ball.

"What are some of the key features and capabilities of Motor-CAD, an electromagnetic and thermal analysis package for electric motors and generators?",24283775,"Motor-CAD is an Electromagnetic and Thermal analysis package for electric motors and generators, developed and sold by Motor Design Ltd. It was initially released in 1999. Modules are available for brushless permanent magnet motors (BPM), outer rotor BPM motors, induction motors, permanent magnet dc machines, switched reluctance motors, synchronous machines and claw pole machines. An integrated ultra fast finite element module (EMag) provides accurate electromagnetic and electrical performance predictions. The thermal module (Therm) combines lumped circuit and finite element thermal calculations for optimising the cooling system of the machine. Cooling methods modelled include natural convection, forced convection, through ventilation, water jackets, submersible, wet rotor and wet stator, spray cooling, radiation and conduction.
A wide range of housing types can be modelled. The Lab module works with the EMag and Therm modules to help develop new design concepts. It provides efficiency mapping and duty cycle / drive cycle transient outputs within a few minutes. Thermal analysis of electric machines is regarded as a more challenging area of analysis than electromagnetic analysis in the construction of the model and the accuracy achievable. Thermal analysis of electrical machines is becoming ever more important due to the increasing drive for energy efficiency and compact design machines. This is particularly true for the aerospace and automotive sectors where size, weight and efficiency are driving the design of machines.
The design approach often taken is to consider both electromagnetic and thermal aspects of a machines design at the early stages in machine design, where Motor-CAD allows this to be done. Other possible thermal modelling techniques include computational fluid dynamics. Motor-CAD has been shown to give results with a similar accuracy in a fraction of the time.",5.317
